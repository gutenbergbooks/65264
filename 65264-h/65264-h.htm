<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The subject dealt with in the
present work touches one of
the dark patches of our social life. Flogging
as an aid to education, a mode of discipline,
or a means of repression is universal
in time and space. The subject has always
had a strange fascination for curious minds.
The facts presented here are all drawn from
authentic sources. They are stated plainly,
without any attempt at colouring them.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL
AND CLOISTER</h2>


<p>Right up to the beginning of the present
century the birch rod was an ordinary part
of a school&#8217;s equipment, and only a few
years have elapsed since it was looked on
by the schoolmaster as the <i>ultima ratio</i>.
Indeed, we would not swear that, in certain
out-of-the-way places where, in spite of the
railway, civilization has not yet penetrated,
the teacher is not still known by the insulting
but picturesque name of bum-brusher.
Today, at any rate in our French schools,
this method of correction has been abandoned;
and yet, is the time so far gone
when it would have been regarded as revolutionary
not to use the whip or rod?</p>

<p>But was corporal punishment really effi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>cacious
with vicious and undisciplined children?
Was there no risk of defeating one&#8217;s
own object&#8212;might not a slumbering vice
be aroused in the attempt to train an ill-formed
character?</p>

<p>This consideration had not escaped the
wisdom of a theologian, who was also a
medical man, Father Debreyne: &#8216;Flagellation
may have a result quite different from
what one expected. It is therefore very
important to abolish this form of punishment
from our homes and schools as being
indecent, disgraceful, and dangerous to
morals.&#8217;</p>

<p>Should we have a more perverse imagination
than our ancestors if we credited them
with malign thoughts; or must we believe
that a wind of sadism has blown over our
poor humanity during long centuries? Assuredly,
the intentions of most of them
were pure, but how many black sheep there
may have been in the flock!</p>



<p class="tb">In primitive times the whip was the attribute
of brute force. The father, having
complete authority over his child, delegates
this authority to the teacher, who exercises
it with more or less rigour according to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
temperament or temper.</p>

<p>The best policed people have not felt called
upon to abandon this instrument of government.
If education was severe in Sparta,
where children were submitted early to
the most difficult exercises, it was hardly
any milder at Athens, if we are to judge by
this description of Greek customs. &#8216;Hardly
had a child escaped from the tyranny of
his nurse, when he fell into the hands of
the teacher, the grammarian, and the musician,
and these took turns at flogging him
to teach him their art. As he grows up,
there arrive the arithmetician, the geometer,
and the riding-master. Under these
masters he gets no rest, he rises early, and
is often flogged. A little older, and it is
the tactician and gymnastic instructor who
now flog and torture him.&#8217; And there have
been philosophers to praise and poets to
sing the happy results of this brutal method.</p>

<p>However, one voice is raised against this
system&#8212;the voice of Plutarch, who considers
that we should lead children to do
their duty by kind words and gentle remonstrances
and not by blows, for flogging is
more suitable for slaves than the free. It
hardens and deadens them, and the pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
and shame makes them hate work. Praise
and blame are more suitable for freeborn
children than whips and rods.</p>

<p>Rome had borrowed this method of treating
slaves from Greece. According to Petronius,
the following notice could be seen
on the fronts of certain houses: &#8216;Slaves
who leave this house without permission
will receive one hundred lashes.&#8217;</p>

<p>The least impatience of the mistress, or
the least fault of the female-slave sufficed
to get the latter hung up by the hair and
lashed till the blood came. The picture
which Juvenal, <span class="smcap">Sat.</span> vi, has left of these
scenes is simply revolting. This practice
was so common that, in his <i>Art of Love</i>,
Ovid recommends women not to give way
to anger in the presence of the lover who is
watching them at their toilet. Many of
them, indeed, had the rather unhappy habit
of choosing this moment for beating and
biting their slaves, or sticking hairpins in
their breasts. And let us not forget that
these pins were seven or eight inches long.
Flogging must have seemed very mild
alongside such a martyrdom, and we are no
longer astonished that the satirical Horace
thanks his teacher Orbilius for having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
soundly flogged him when at school.</p>

<p>It was not always the pupils who lent
their ... backs to the rod: the master&#8217;s turn
came one day. Livy reports that a schoolmaster
was condemned to be flogged for
having committed treason. After he had
been stripped of all his clothing and his
hands tied behind him, he was handed over
to the children, who flogged him heartily.
The roles were indeed changed.</p>

<p>From time to time sensitive spirits protested
against these methods of education,
although the custom was quite generally
received and approved. There was some
merit in protesting when one was quite
alone in the belief.</p>

<p>Quintilian wished to abolish flogging, and
the only fault about his reasons was that
they were addressed to barbarians who
were not yet ready to understand. &#8216;I would
like scholars not to be beaten: firstly, such
treatment is degrading and used for slaves;
if the victims were older they would be
justified in claiming reparation. Secondly,
because if a child is so stubborn that reprimands
do not cure him, there is every possibility
of his being made worse by blows,
as are rebellious slaves; besides, such pun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>ishment
would be needless if the teacher
understood his work. But nowadays teachers
are so careless in their corrections that,
instead of compelling the scholars to do
what they should, they are content to punish
them when they have not done it.</p>

<p>Further, if we constrain a boy with
stripes, how shall we treat a young man
who cannot be flogged, and whose honour
should be appealed to encourage him to
study? Add to that, that accidents happen
to those who are beaten which decency
forbids us to describe, and which are caused
by fear and pain. The shame felt by the
victims injures them and cows them to such
an extent that they fly from the light and
sink under their shame. If wise and skilful
teachers have not been chosen, it is impossible
to say to what extremes of cruelty
they may not go, and to what extent they
will terrify their pupils.&#8217; Bk. 1, iii.</p>

<p>Quintilian addressed the empty air. He
spent his efforts in sheer waste, trying to
uproot a prejudice which was to last longer
than he.</p>



<p class="tb">The Jesuits have been charged with the
invention of pedagogical flogging&#8212;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
might well reply that they had many precursors.
The history of monastic flagellation
is an argument they would have been
justified in urging in support. But they
have a respondent of another opinion. Has
not Solomon said: &#8216;Spare the rod and
spoil the child?&#8217;</p>

<p>In the <i>Coutumes de Cluny</i>, written by the
monk Udabric in 1087, we read: &#8216;At prayers,
if the children sing badly or fall asleep,
the prior or master will strip them to their
shirt and flog them with osiers or specially
prepared cords.&#8217;</p>

<p>We know nothing of the duration of the
punishments, but the following fact plainly
shows that the delinquents were intimidated.
On St. Mark&#8217;s Day some scholars of
St. Gall&#8217;s had incurred the punishment of a
flogging for truancy. The boy who was
sent to the attic to fetch the rods, wishing
to save himself and his comrades from the
punishment, seized a burning brand and set
fire to the abbey. This simple fact plainly
shows that the children of those days were
little rascals, and one is not surprised to
find a priest complaining to St. Anselme du
Bec that he could do nothing with his pupils
although he thrashed them soundly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>It is true he might have had recourse to
a more gradual system of education, like
that proposed by a bishop of Metz&#8212;at the
first offence the offender was to be warned:
at the second, admonished: at the third,
publicly reprimanded: at the fourth, he
was to be put on bread and water: at the
fifth, to be separated from the rest of the
community and locked up or beaten, <i>if his
age permitted</i>: and lastly, if those corrections
were ineffective, God should be asked
to cure him, and he should be taken before
the bishop.</p>

<p>Let us be just: if there were some incorrigible
children, certain masters treated
them with a brutality which invited reprisals.
On that, we have undeniable testimony.
Guilbert de Nogent, speaking of the master
who had trained him, pays homage to his
virtue but confesses that he overwhelmed
him almost daily with cuffs and blows, to
force him to learn what he himself could
not teach. &#8216;One day when I had been
thrashed I went and sat at my mother&#8217;s
knees, cruelly hurt and most certainly more
than I deserved. My mother having asked
me, as was her custom, if I had been beaten
again, I, not wishing to denounce my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
master, said that I hadn&#8217;t. But, in spite
of my resistance, she pulled aside my shirt
and saw my blackened arms and weal-marked
shoulders.</p>

<p>As in ecclesiastical schools, so also in
monasteries and convents was flogging in
vogue. A rule of St. Cesaire d&#8217;Arles, dating
from the year 508, stipulates the punishment
of flagellation for unruly nuns.</p>

<p>St. Benoit, the restorer of monastic discipline
in France, who began his reform in
the eight century, prescribed excessive fasts
and harsh and bloody flagellations, even
for children. If a brother, after having
been often checked, neglects to correct
himself, he must be punished with strokes.
If anyone soils or damages the monastery
fitments, he is to be checked and punished
according to rule, if he does not mend. If
a monk is found with anything claimed as
his own property, it is to be taken from him
up to two times; if he does not correct
himself, he is to be severely punished. If
anyone violates the rule of silence, he shall
be severely chastised, likewise he who receives
books or presents; who reports what
he has seen or heard during a voyage; he
who takes upon himself to publicly repri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>mand
persons older than himself without
an express order from an abbot; or even
he who shall correct children with too much
warmth and severity. Disobedience of the
abbot was also to be punished in the same
way.</p>

<p>St. Colomban enters into the most minute
details for the administration of discipline
to ecclesiastics: so many strokes for
the monk who has not prostrated himself
when going out of the monastery: so many
for him who, at the beginning of a meal,
has not made the sign of the cross on his
spoon: so many for him who has not trimmed
his nails before saying mass: so many
for him who has not gathered up his crumbs
at table. The superior allotted the punishment
and generally administered it.</p>

<p>Another rule stipulates that the monks
who shall have gone out of the monastery
without the permission of their superior, or
who, having been allowed out have not returned
as soon as the errand was finished,
shall be excommunicated for thirty days or
beaten with rods; the same punishment
for those who have eaten or drunk to excess.
Young monks who have been convicted
of theft are never to be promoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the clericature.</p>

<p>The monks who, after having been excommunicated,
should wish to re-enter the
community of their brothers (Rule of St.
Macaire), are to be flogged in the presence
of the abbot and the whole community in
order that, it not having been possible to
correct them by remonstrances, they shall
be corrected by rods.</p>

<p>The monks who shall disturb their brothers
or impose on their simplicity, shall be
whipped before the door of the monastery
if, after having been warned three times,
they do not correct themselves. (Rule of
St. Pacôme).</p>

<p>The monks who will not forgive those
who have offended them and who strike
their brothers, must be treated in a similar
manner; but whatever the offence may be,
the number of strokes shall not exceed the
thirty-nine allowed by law. (Rule of St.
Aurelian).</p>

<p>And let the victims beware they do not
complain, if they wish to escape severer
punishment!</p>

<p>The whip serves also to lead back to the
path of duty those monks who speak too
loudly, who are angry, who make others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
laugh, who rail, who calumniate&#8212;at least,
if they do not correct themselves after having
been warned several times. The same
treatment must be meted out to those who
are lewd, impudent, and haughty; to those
who are liars, thieves, and blackguards; to
those who are wild and stubborn, and who
boldly sustain their faults. (Rule of Saint
Fructueux).</p>

<p>Neither young brothers under fifteen nor
nuns who have committed a theft are excused
a flogging; nor are the nuns who
have struck their sisters, or are guilty of
certain crimes. And so we come to learn
how common were acts of indecency in
these communities where only the divine
spirit should have entered.</p>

<p>Licentious conversations with a person of
the same or the opposite sex, as also the
more intimate relations, are taken account
of by monastic regulations.</p>

<p>The crime of frequenting women was
punished with repeated fustigations. Those
who persisted in casting lascivious glances
on women might, after having been flogged,
be expelled from the community, for fear
their bad example might contaminate their
brethren. One rule assimilates the monk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
convicted with theft with an adulterer, for
&#8216;it can only be lust which has led him to
commit a theft.&#8217;</p>

<p>We have an example of the severity with
which crimes of this nature were punished
in the story of a nun who was accused and
convicted of incest, by the Council of Donzi,
June 13th, 874.</p>

<p>This nun was named Duda; she had sinned
with a priest named Humbert. The
latter denied the charge, but the two guilty
persons were overwhelmed by the evidence.
It was in fact proved that they had two
accomplices, two nuns named Bertha and
Erprède.</p>

<p>The punishment awarded by the council
deserves to be set on record: for three
years Duda was to be flogged on the back
with rods in the presence of the abbess and
the other nuns, in order to expiate by the
pains of the flesh, the faults which the
pleasures of the flesh had made her commit.
For the next three years she was authorised
to share the prayers with the other sisters;
however, she was not to be in the choir
with them, but behind the door or in such
other place as the abbess would indicate.
The seventh year, she might go to the offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>ing,
but after the others, and at the end of
the year she might receive the body and
blood of Our Lord if she were really penitent.
She was warned never to forget the
sin, and to move always with downcast
eyes, and to make the sign of the cross
whenever she was tormented with impure
thoughts. As to the two accomplices, the
council imposed a penitence of three years
and a half, during which time they were to
be flogged for not having divulged their
sister&#8217;s secret to those who could have prevented
so grave a scandal.</p>

<p>We have sometimes been reproached for
using in our various writings terms which
really belong to medicine: it is amusing to
see ourselves justified by a theologian, the
Abbé Thiers, who is accusing a colleague of
having erred in that direction. &#8216;There is
nothing to be said against medical men,
when speaking of parts of the human body,
using the most proper and natural terms to
explain what modesty forbids us to name
on other occasions: the necessity of their
profession compels them so to do; but that
a priest, a doctor of theology, writing a history
which might well be written without
the admission of impure facts, yet admits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
many which have no bearing on this subject,
this, I feel, is beyond excuse.&#8217;</p>

<p>The worthy Abbé Boileau, who is hinted
at here, has however denied having written
an immoral work. Has he not proclaimed
that the usage of lower discipline (he could
hardly have been more discreet in his expression)
is nearly always not only unprecedented,
new, and useless, but even bad, infamous,
and very shameful?</p>

<p>It would be unjust not to admit that it
was this custom he combatted and tried to
abolish. Although he was in a position to
know of all the excesses which are committed
in monasteries, he has nevertheless not
drawn aside all the veil; there are others
who have not had the same scruples, and
those who are in love with truth have reason
therefore to congratulate themselves.</p>

<p class="tb">Even had the written word failed to inform
us, religious iconography would have
supplied the missing facts. Glance at a
15th century manuscript preserved in the
Bourgogne Library at Brussels: could words
say more? There we see a monk being
flogged in the presence of his brothers, and
the field of operation laid bare to their view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>The same treatment was also meted out
in convents: for moral offences, for negligence
or slackness in the performance of
religious duties, the superior punished the
offender in the presence of all the other sisters
so that the words of the apostle might
be fulfilled: &#8216;Let sinners be confounded in
the sight of all.&#8217;</p>

<p>In an assembly of ecclesiastics held at
Aix-la-Chapelle in 817, it was decided that
monks should be flogged naked before all
their brethren. It would appear that the
penitence was more meritorious when it
was applied <i>in anima vili</i> (<i>in corpore vili</i>
would be more in keeping with the facts).</p>

<p>The constitution of the Carmelites stipulated
that the master of the novices was
to flog them gently, after having decently
uncovered the bottom of the back. In some
communities, shirts had to be made open
at the back so that they could be opened
and allow a fair field.</p>

<p>In several convents there were novices
who were trained specially for administering
discipline. The Ursulines had a mistress
specialty charged to teach them how
to hold the instrument, how to lengthen
and shorten their arm so that the blows got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
home effectively, and how to maintain a
decent posture.</p>

<p>One of the masters of the art of flagellation,
Julien de la Croix, wanted the lashes
to be of unequal length so that they fell
in different places and widened the tormented
area.</p>

<p>A daughter of Louis XI, Jeanne de
France, invented a scourge which made
five wounds. It was a silver cross, armed
with five spikes.</p>

<p class="tb">Flagellation was not only applied in monasteries;
very soon a number of bishops
claimed the same right over their priests as
abbots had over monks.</p>

<p>Although monks, priests, and deacons
were, by special canon, exempt from abbatial
fustigation, the monk Godescal submitted
to it with grand apparel in the presence
of Charles the Bald. The bishop of Spire
was flogged by order Pope John XII.</p>

<p>This punishment was frequently used
with heretics when they were no longer immured
for life, or burnt alive. Their rank
was no safeguard against this infamous
chastisement.</p>

<p>Prince Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
suspected of heresy, was publicly flogged
outside the church of St. Gilles, Valencia,
by the hand of the pope&#8217;s legate. Henry II
of England was publicly flogged to expiate
the murder of the archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>The son and successor of Philippe Auguste,
Louis VIII, being found guilty of
having continued to claim the English
crown when the pope had taken it from
him (after having freely given it him), was
compelled to expiate this rebellion by consenting
to pay the pope a tenth of his income
for two years, and to present himself
barefooted and with a rod at the door of
Notre Dame, Paris, there to be flogged by
the canons. Report says that he was flogged
on the backs of his chaplains.</p>

<p>Henry IV also was whipped, in 1595, but
this was on the backs of his ambassadors,
Cardinals du Perron and d&#8217;Ossat.</p>

<p>This vicarious flagellation was not exceptional.
In the last century but one there
could always be found, and almost anywhere,
some worthy capuchin who was
willing to make his buttocks responsible for
the sins of the whole parish, and who, proportionate
to the payment received, would
flog himself&#8212;or at least give out that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
had done so. From thence comes the famous
Spanish saying: <i>yo soy el culo del fray</i>:
which in the interpretation may be rendered:
I feel as sore and rum as the friar&#8217;s bum.</p>

<p>This symbolic application is met with
again in the ceremony of absolution for excommunicated
persons. The pleader (if a
man), had to present himself before the
church door with bared shoulders, and before
the bishop or priest who was presiding
at the ceremony. Kneeling, and bare headed,
he had to humbly beg for the absolution
of his sin; and then the priest, having
made him swear to obey the commandments
of the church, would sit down and,
taking a whip or rod, would recite a long
psalm and, at each verse, he would strike
the petitioner.</p>

<p>The ceremonial was somewhat more solemn
for those who had been excommunicated
with anathema, or for those who had
been excommunicated for grave sins or
serious crimes.</p>

<p>Illustrious personages, among others William,
Duke of Aquitaine: Raymond, Count
of Toulouse: Foulques, Count of Anjou,
etc., submitted to this humiliating penitence.
The last named had married the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
widow of Alain de Bretagne and had had
her son, the heir to the estate, drowned in
a bath. In reparation for this crime he
went to Jerusalem, accompanied by two
servants, one of whom led him by a rope
which was fastened round his neck like a
victim for the gallows, dragging him thus
to the Holy Sepulchre, while the other continually
flogged him with a bundle of rods.</p>

<p class="tb">A rarely consulted source of documentation
is the collection of letters of remission.
Among other prerogatives, the French kings
enjoyed the right of pardon. They exercised
this right by divers acts, known under
different names: letters of grace, of remission,
of abolition, of pardon, repeal of bans,
and so on.</p>

<p>Among these letters of remission there
are two which have particularly held our
attention: one dates from the end of the
fourteenth, and the other from the first
half of the fifteenth centuries. The first
concerns a man named Durand Tontif, a
schoolmaster at Brienon. It was this teachers
custom at the end of the class, to have
his pupils recite, each in his turn, a <i>De profundis</i>
and a <i>Paternoster</i> for the dead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
district. One day, one of the boys either
wouldn&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t recite the psalm and
the master, from the height of his chair,
struck the child several times on the head
with his birch. In trying to escape, the
poor boy was struck on his ears and face,
and was soon drenched with blood. As he
still persisted in not saying the lesson, the
master sprang down from his seat, flung
the boy on the floor and flogged him unmercifully.
The wretched boy had been
operated on a few days before for stone in
the bladder and was not yet recovered. He
struggled to his feet as best he could and
dragged himself home to bed. He died a
few days later from the blows he had received.
The brutal teacher was arrested,
but he obtained a letter of grace from the
king wherein it was stated that he was ignorant
of the boy&#8217;s condition, and that he
had not flogged him from any feeling of
hatred but simply with the object of discipline.
Nevertheless he had to give up
teaching and compensate the parents.
That was in 1398.</p>

<p>The second story shows that in the fourteenth
century masters had little more consideration
for servants than the worst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
savages had for their slaves, and this state
of things lasted till the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>A groom&#8217;s daughter, aged eight, entered
the service of a gentleman, governor of
Langres. She was so ill-treated by her
mistress that she hated her and only awaited
an opportunity to get even. After seven
different attempts, (she was now sixteen),
she tried to blow the place up, having particularly
in view her mistress&#8217;s bedroom.
Caught in the act, she confessed.</p>

<p class="tb">The whip has this undeniable superiority&#8212;before
its omnipotence both gentle and
simple have bowed. That we have already
demonstrated. Since Henry IV, there is a
long list of kings and princes who have
been flogged. No-one thought that strange:
it was the custom of the times. It required
free spirits such as Montaigne or Rabelais
to protest. Most people remembered that
they had been through the mill themselves
and had come out little the worse: their
children must go through the same. There
is plenty of evidence in existence, both
written and illustrated.</p>

<p class="tb">When evoking her memories of childhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Madame de Maintenon relates that, when
she was ten years old, she was brought up
by her aunt Mme. de Villette. Little girls
were not then punished for slander or lying,
or even worse offences&#8212;no, the greatest
crime in their governess&#8217;s eyes was to mess
one&#8217;s apron or get it splashed with ink.
For one thing, one was sure to be whipped,
for the governess had to wash and iron the
apron. Lie as much as you like, no notice
was taken of that&#8212;there was nothing to
wash and iron!</p>

<p>We must not lose sight of the fact that in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a
quite different view was held of idle and intractable
children than the present one.
Our ideas would have seemed ridiculous to
our fathers: they wouldn&#8217;t have understood
them. Not that discipline was always as
rigorous as it was, according to Rabelais,
in the Montagu College, where the pupils
were treated worse than Moorish slaves,
condemned murderers, dogs even! Such
excesses, however, were not allowed in other
schools, and cases are reported where
teachers were charged in the courts for
having ill-treated their pupils; others were
dismissed for punching the boys. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
although cruelty was generally reproved,
no one complained or was shocked at the
use of the birch; in case of need, parents
would ask the teachers not to spare their
children, and these latter accepted the punishment
with the resignation born of the
knowledge that they were being treated as
children always had been treated. They
even went so far as to joke about it.</p>

<p>It was exceptional for them to protest in
a body against a too severe punishment
administered to a boy who had been unruly
or had played truant. They generally accepted
the punishment&#8212;even if they didn&#8217;t
understand the motive.</p>

<p>Thus, in the little town of Die, only the
pupils of the four highest classes were expected
to speak Latin; but all are expressly
forbidden to speak dialect; as for French,
a boy would only be punished for speaking
it if he were caught in the act, and after
having been previously warned. And what
is done at Die is done, more or less, everywhere.</p>

<p>There are also forbidden games, for playing
which one gets it &#8216;on the back&#8217; as the
scholastic euphemism has it. Games which
do not exercise the body are forbidden;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
also those played for money or other gain,
such as games with cards or dice. Books,
bags, belts, etc., must not be lost or sold,
and no trading carried on in the school.
Those who play about in the privies, or who
stay longer than is necessary, are to be
flogged.</p>

<p>Flogging was used in all educational establishments,
whether at Port Royal or under
the jesuits. There was, however, a
Jansenist named Varet who was not afraid
to write that &#8216;the severity recommended
by Holy Writ is much better exercised and
more in accordance with the spirit of God,
by the refusal of a kiss or caress, rather
than by the use of a rod.&#8217; It wasn&#8217;t that
he wished to spare them pain, for he adds:
&#8216;If they have some infirmity or sickness,
although in secret you spare no effort to
cure them, try however to teach them to
bear their pains with resignation.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb">It would appear that the rigour of the
pedagogical rules of the jesuits has been
exaggerated. A number of stories, and
some of them only stories, have contributed
to establish this reputation: this one, for
instance, from the <i>Memoirs of the Count de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Bonneval</i>. &#8216;The Marquis de C..., a cavalry
captain, had been stationed for a year or
two in the outskirts of Strasburg. He often
visited the town and had a mistress there.
He abandoned her in a rather shameful
way, and she resolved to be avenged and
as cruelly as possible.</p>

<p>&#8216;She conceived the plan of writing to the
rector of the jesuits, in the name of the
Marquis of Louvois. The letter stated that
a certain cavalry officer would call on him,
that the king desired that he should be given
twenty-five lashes by the corrector of his
college in the presence of three or four of
most respectable monks. The letter further
stated that the victim should lean on the
table and cross his thumbs during the punishment,
and that he should give ten louis
to the corrector and thank him for the correction
given. It ended by an order to the
rector that he should give a detailed account
of all that happened.</p>

<p>&#8216;While this ridiculous letter was being
read by the jesuits and they were rejoicing
that they had the confidence of M. de Louvois,
the captain received one by the same
hand ordering him to go on Friday to the
jesuit corrector, who would give him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
king&#8217;s commands. He impatiently awaited
the day, and went to the college at the indicated
hour, 8 p.m. He was first shown
into an inner room and there told the orders
which concerned him. These imbecile
monks, who were unable to understand
that these orders, accompanied with so
many ridiculous circumstances, could not
possibly have come from the court, pleaded
earnestly with the captain to submit. He
was fool enough to believe them, and indeed
prepared himself for the flogging, which
was soundly administered. The treatment
was accompanied with a reprimand which
his young lady had dictated. He gave ten
louis to the corrector and thanked him, and
the jesuits promised to keep the affair
secret.&#8217;</p>

<p>To understand better the educational
methods of the jesuits, it is preferable to
consult their <i>Ratio studiorum</i>, published in
1599. This <i>Ratio</i> states that a punishment
should only be given in a last extremity.
&#8216;Let not the master be in haste to punish:
let him not push his inquisition too far:
let him pretend that he does not see all the
faults committed, if he can do so without
compromising the interests of the pupils.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>In another passage they are recommended
to avoid corporal punishment as much
as possible, and in any case they are not to
use the rod themselves. A special corrector,
attached to the establishment but not a
member of the order, was detailed for flogging.
The corrector was a servant, either
the cook or the doorman; sometimes recourse
was had to a penniless workman of
the district, who was given a few coppers
for fulfilling the office.</p>

<p>In the Toulouse province, at Rodez College
for example, another plan was used.
The jesuits picked out a hefty scholar and
educated him gratis, on condition that he
flogged his fellow-pupils when necessary.
The victim was fastened to the back of a
chair, and the punishment took place before
the teacher and all the class. The number
of strokes given was usually from seventy
to eighty, never less than forty; sometimes
as many as three hundred were given.</p>

<p>The victim was forbidden to cry out, and
the flogger was ordered to pause for a few
seconds between each stroke so that the
pain might be greater.</p>

<p>During the reign of Louis XIV, public
opinion pronounced in favour of corporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
punishment so vigorously that elected bodies
thought it not beneath their dignity to
pick up the rods which had fallen from the
hands of too-indulgent teachers. And yet
as a general thing, there was little consideration
shown for either age or condition, as
the following episode related by Saint Simon
of the oldest son of the Marquis de
Boufflers will show.</p>

<p>This boy was fourteen years old, almost
a young man, handsome, well-built, clever,
and very promising. He was a boarder
with the jesuits, along with the two sons of
d&#8217;Argenson.</p>

<p>The fathers wished to show that they
feared and favoured nobody, so they flogged
the boy, though as a matter of fact they
had nothing to fear from the Marquis.
They were careful however not to touch the
other two, for they were liable to be called
to account any day by d&#8217;Argenson, lieutenant
of police. Boufflers was so dismayed
and oppressed that he fell sick, and died in
four days. There was a universal outcry,
but nothing happened.</p>

<p>In a society where the birch was looked
on as an indispensable teaching aid, indignation
was unlikely to be long-lived, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
so it was freely used in town and country.
We will mention one case, because it recalls
the name of a famous novelist. The grandfather
of Restif de la Bretonne gave his son,
aged eighteen, three strokes with a whip
which fetched blood through his shirt, because
he had spoken several times to a girl
without permission. This same son, now a
father of fourteen children, flogged them
with more circumspection: in case of a serious
punishment he simply threatened them
with the whip at first, and allowed a week
to pass between the threat and the flogging,
so that it should impress the child more.</p>

<p>This authority of the father over his
children is still existent in rural districts.
The Goncourts relate in their <i>Journal</i> that
an old friend of theirs, a doctor, had just
married off his daughter. She quarrelled
with her husband. Her father caught her
up under his arm, turned up her skirts and
unfastened her drawers, and soundly smacked
her. Then, turning to his dumbfounded
son-in-law, he calmly said: &#8216;There, that&#8217;ll
quieten her down a bit.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb">In a list of the personnel of the Mazarin
College, dating from the eighteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
there appears this item: <i>Chevallier, floor-polisher
and corrector</i>. This humble official
represented an institution which had been
preserved intact throughout the centuries.</p>

<p>&#8216;How changed the times are!&#8217; exclaimed
Caraccioli, under Louis XVI. &#8216;Flogging is
almost abandoned; conduct is governed
more by honour than punishment, though
the indecent and barbarous method of flogging
is not yet entirely abolished.&#8217;</p>

<p>The rod was still a part of school equipment
in the second half of the eighteenth
century. Besnard reports that the head of
the college where he studied always appeared
in class armed with a flat strip of whale-bone
which had a silver ferrule at each end.
He would use this on the knuckles of inattentive
pupils without any warning. He
also kept a rod and whip handy, and freely
used them.</p>

<p>The cry of Erasmus&#8217;s student: <i>Væ nostris
natibus</i>, was heard up to and beyond
the revolutionary epoch. One of the institutions
which no-one thought of attacking
in the years preceding the cataclysm was
this one of fustigation. The Abbé Morellet
states that he was flogged by the jesuits
every Saturday. Voltaire had a painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
memory of blows received. Marmontel, a
student of philosophy, escaped a flogging
only by causing the whole college to revolt.
La Reveillère-Lepeaux, a day-boarder at a
priest&#8217;s, attributed his deformity to the
blows he was always getting on his back.
Lastly, G. de Pixérécourt the dramatist,
even goes so far as to say that his liability
to gout was contracted in early youth by
his having to kneel on the threshold of the
school to receive the floggings he was always
getting.</p>

<p>At Troyes College, a few years before the
Revolution, the teacher of rhetoric wanted
to cane one of his pupils; the others were
indignant and cried out&#8212;a student of rhetoric,
eighteen years old, to be punished like
a child! One voice was raised which thundered
out above all the rest. This young
orator, whose first triumph this was, was
no other than Danton. The student whose
part he had taken was Paré; the Minister
of Justice of 1792 made him Home Secretary
in 1793. College friendships are useful
sometimes.</p>

<p>There are two countries, neighbours of
ours, where the rod still has a place of honour&#8212;we
mean England and Germany. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
America, flogging has received the development
we should expect in the land of Edison.
Some years ago the Chicago papers
reported that the staff of the Denver Industrial
School for Girls had installed an electric
flogging machine. The apparatus consisted
of a chair with an open seat on which
the victim, suitably unclothed, was placed.
The chair was high enough to allow four
beaters, which were fixed under the seat, to
revolve, more or less rapidly, according to
the wish of the operator, who had only to
press a button to set the machine in motion.
The advantage of the beaters was that the
action was regular and imposed no fatigue
on the operator. Ingenious, but hardly
likely to be used outside of America.</p>

<p>A correspondent relates in the <i>Revue des
Deux Mondes</i>, March, 1883, that he saw a
young man, six feet tall, flogged at an English
college. This man had bought a commission
in a cavalry regiment and was to
leave in a few days to join up. Having
copiously feted Bacchus to celebrate the
occasion, he was brought in dead-drunk,
and for this breach of the rules he was condemned
to be flogged. Resigned to his
fate, he was given twelve strokes, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
quitted the college on the best of terms
with everyone.</p>

<p>The head of this college, Dr. Goodford,
was convinced that the whip was the best
of teachers, and it was no kindness to youth
to spare it. A tale is related bearing on
this point which, if not very credible, is
based on fact.</p>

<p>A pupil who had refused to be flogged
had been sent down. Sometime afterward,
attacked by remorse, he went from Yorkshire
to Eton to undergo his punishment.
Dr. Goodford had just gone to Switzerland,
and the young man asked where he could
find him.</p>

<p>He bought the regulation birch, packed
it in his trunk, and set out to find his head-master.
He missed him at Geneva, then
at Lucerne, but at last caught him up at
St. Bernard&#8217;s. There Goodford, touched
by the recital of his odyssey, resolved to
reward such praiseworthy perseverance.
And it was in the refectory of the monastery,
in presence of the monks who stood
round gaping with wonder and admiration,
that he flogged him soundly. That done,
and with lips pursed up, he gave him a
copy of Murray&#8217;s Guide as a present. Quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
English, you know!</p>

<p>There is very little caning or flogging in
the elementary schools in England, whereas
in the secondary schools corporal punishment
is common. It is the opposite in
Germany. Children from six to fourteen
may be caned or whipped. Teachers are
warned not to abuse this punishment, which
must be behind closed doors and in the
presence of another teacher and the head-master.
If the pupil is a girl, the regulation
states that nothing should be done to offend
modesty. Only sick and delicate children
are exempted. This mixture of sentimentalism
and brutality is very characteristic of
prudish Germany.</p>

<h2>EXPERIENCES OF FLAGELLATION<br /><br />

FLOGGING GIRLS</h2>


<p>Discursive readers of weekly and monthly
journals, and especially of those organs
which are addressed to the fair sex, are
aware that correspondence is among their
leading features. Women&#8217;s papers are usually
half made up of questions and answers.
One may say of their patrons, as
of the people in the days of Noah, that in
these free and frank columns they buy and
sell, eat and drink, marry and are given in
marriage&#8212;for there barter-markets are established,
whereby the gentle merchants
exchange old music for ostrich feathers and
the like; there cookery recipes by the score
are asked for; while the love affairs avowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and consulted upon are endless. We trust
that we may be permitted, for the edification
of the general public, to draw upon the
treasures of a remarkable interchange of
opinion appearing in this way in our amiable
contemporary <i>The Englishwoman&#8217;s Domestic
Journal</i>. It seems that the question
had arisen whether or not it was desirable
or proper to flog children generally, and
growing girls in particular. We are not
able to state the origin of the epistolary
quarrel: our attention has been arrested by
the hot battle with which it closes, and from
it we shall glean the amazing views which
certain English parents seem to entertain
respecting home discipline.</p>

<p>As far as we can gather, <i>A Perplexed
Mamma</i> began the controversy by asking
what she should do with her unruly girls;
and, upon this, <i>Pro-Rod, A Lover of Obedience</i>,
and certain other enthusiasts for domestic
flogging, warmly recommended the
birch. At the point of the contest where
we come in, this view is ardently sustained
by a phalanx of terrible mammas, sternly
brandishing slippers, canes, or birch twigs.
<i>A Teacher of Troublesome Girls</i> writes: &#8216;I
should strongly recommend <i>A Perplexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Mamma</i> to try the effect of a smart whipping,
and I think if administered to the
eldest it will very likely be beneficial to the
younger ones. I do not think the slipper
of much use as an instrument of punishment,
unless for quite young children.&#8217; <i>A
Schoolmistress</i> takes the same view of the
slipper as an instrument of virtue, and advocates
&#8216;uncovering the victim, and applying
the punishment to a portion of the
frame morally most sensitive.&#8217; These connoisseurs
in justice are backed by <i>Pater</i>,
who appears to be both father and mother
to his hapless offspring. He says: &#8216;Two
years ago I lost my wife, having two daughters,
aged twelve and fourteen years, and
found them completely defying control. I
consulted with their aunts on the mother&#8217;s
side, and with several medical men, upon
the punishment of refractory girls and women
in reformatories; all agreed that whipping
in the usual manner was the best mode
to adopt, and that, however severely the
rod was applied, no personal injury would
result, nor would the health suffer. I therefore
adopted this punishment, but privately
in my bedroom.&#8217;</p>

<p>To these awful aunts on the mother&#8217;s side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
and this reformatory <i>Pater</i>, succeeds an unabashed
<i>Lover of the Rod</i>, whose heart is
sad because she has observed of late years
a tendency to go to a perfect idolatry of
children. This gentle creature applauds
Solomon&#8217;s precept&#8212;forgetting, apparently,
that Rehoboam turned out a particularly
bad boy&#8212;and &#8216;heartily believes in the good
old birch.&#8217; She gives her advice thus: &#8216;On
the first occasion on which the girls show
signs of disobedience, order all three up to
the mother&#8217;s bedroom, to wait until she
comes. I would keep them all three in suspense,
as not comprehending your intentions.
Then I would provide myself either
with a good birchrod or cane (a cane is very
severe), go upstairs, shut the doors, at once
tell the oldest one you are going to give her
a flogging. Doubtless she will feel much
astonished and very indignant; but if you
are firm, and threaten to call in the servant
to help you, she will submit. There must
be shame as well as pain in this; but she
has deserved them, in my opinion; and one
such punishment, in the presence of her two
sisters, will do everything.&#8217; But rod and
slipper are despised by <i>Another Lover of
Obedience</i>. His method is: &#8216;When children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
commit an offence, I do not punish them at
the time, but order them to my bedroom
some few hours after. The effect of my
discipline is such that they never fail to do
so. When there they are laid across the
bed, their clothes removed, and from fifteen
to fifty smart strokes administered, the
amount varying with the offence. After
this I can assure you they are perfectly docile
for some time to come. I have tried
many systems, but find this to be the best.
I should advise all to follow this same plan;
they will find it answer remarkably well.
Even at the age of eighteen, should my
children require it, I will administer corporal
punishment.&#8217; After such an inventive
enthusiast for obedience, who dexterously
combines suspense with agony, we must
hold most reasonable the plea of another
fond parent, who thinks that there is nothing
wrong in slapping baby &#8216;with a satin
slipper, to let it know there is a will superior
to its own.&#8217; This would seem to be the
<i>elegantiæ</i> of the Art, the very esthetics of
corporal punishment&#8212;were it not for the
same mamma&#8217;s declaration that she &#8216;detests
the moral system.&#8217; Should the baby
grow up unimproved by slipper, a resource<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
is offered her, and those like her, by yet
another <i>Lover of Obedience</i> who writes: &#8216;the
editor has my address, and I hope will be
kind enough to give it any mother who may
wish to send her daughters to me for a few
months; I will return them obedient and
good. I have never yet taken charge of
young ladies, but would willingly do so to
prove my theory correct.&#8217;</p>

<p>With this ogress, panting for the screams
and blood of victims whom she offers to
manufacture into slaves, we close our quotations
on one side. We owe it to the <i>Englishwoman&#8217;s
Journal</i> and Englishwomen
generally, that we should set off against
these abominable letters a few of the indignant
protests which happily appear on the
other side. Honour to the <i>Lady of Title</i>
who hears with shame and a shock &#8216;the
scenes that seem to go on in some houses.&#8217;
Several <i>English Mothers</i> express their deep
indignation and shame at the correspondence
on the pro-rod side.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Gentleness</i> believes that such mothers and
fathers &#8216;must have nigger blood in them,&#8217;
and &#8216;have learned in suffering what they
teach in shame.&#8217; <i>Martha</i> &#8216;trusts that if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
<i>Perplexed Mother</i> attempts to flog her eldest
daughter the tables will be turned, and she
may suffer herself; then she will know
whether corporal punishment is effectual or
not.&#8217; <i>A Christian Parent</i> says very rightly:
&#8216;As for the <i>English Mamma</i> who has stated
that she inflicts twenty strokes with a birch
upon her luckless offspring, she herself, by
this admission, most requires correction,
and a sound scourging would be a fitting
punishment for such unwomanly brutality.
Patience, gentleness, and firmness are the
qualities required in dealing with children
and all young people; but like produces
like, and in each of the above cases the violent
and evil passions of the child are but
inherited from the father or mother. On
the parents, therefore, the chief blame
should rest, and to discipline <i>themselves</i> is
my advice.&#8217; <i>S. T. R.</i> concludes that some
mothers are literally brute beasts, and does
not wonder that girls arriving at womanhood
escape from such dens at any cost of
self-respect.</p>

<p>There are a few female professors of the
art of domestic education who advocate a
little, just a little of the stick. <i>Trophime</i>
for example would always leave the clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
on if the girl be sixteen; and <i>Experience</i>
uses the rod only as a last resort. But the
overwhelming number of mothers, we are
glad to say, hurl contempt and anathemas
at these cold-blooded <i>Lovers of Obedience</i>
who thus hate their own flesh; and the preponderance
of opinion is entirely with the
moral system which the lady who beats her
baby with a slipper so naturally detests.</p>

<p class="tb">But what a picture of domestic misery
and stupid cruelty is unveiled by the other
side of this extraordinary correspondence!
No wonder that girls go wrong and throw
their womanhood away in sin and anguish,
when their youth is passed with fathers and
mothers whose stupidity is such that they
confound brutality with discipline, and are
not ashamed to boast of the outrages they
commit on their own flesh and blood. If we
have appeared to cite the complacent suggestions
of such people with patience, it is
because no words of condemnation could be
so severe as their own description of themselves
and their ways. To those parents
the great and sacred gift of children has
come like pearls to swine. Perhaps in
many cases it is their heads more than their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
hearts which are at fault, and their dense
ignorance leaves them with no sense of
right. But, whatever may be the cause,
that which they call love of obedience is
lust of powder and wicked impatience; they
play the tyrant over their helpless offspring
and think themselves virtuous, while they
are absolutely criminal. If the secrets of
all hearts were known, it would probably
be seen that the parents who flogged and
tortured their children for lies and evil conduct
first taught them those offences by
their own characters, and deserved the rod
much more thoroughly. This correspondence
is a serious thing; it reveals the existence
of a whole world of unnatural and indefensible
private cruelty of which law
ought to have cognisance. We do not live
in Roman times, when a parent might sell a
son into slavery or take his life. These are
Christian days, and each human soul has
its dignity and its rights, to be respected
and enforced. It would do some of these
smirking malefactors good to be denounced
and punished at the police court for what
is not less an assault with violence because
it is committed by a child&#8217;s natural protector.
We have all learned from Mr. Rar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>ey
that whipping is the worst way, and
gentleness the best way, with horses, dogs,
and the dumb creation generally. We have
abolished flogging in the army, and it will
linger only during this session in the navy.
The cat is now reserved as an indescribable
disgrace for garotters in goal, and&#8212;as it
seems&#8212;for the tender girl-children of many
a &#8216;respectable&#8217; household. Emphatically
we denounce this relic of the past generation;
we say that to beat a girl-child is
shameful and abominable, and never yet
had any result but mischief to the victim
and degradation to the executioner. As one
reads these detestable confessions, there can
no longer be any surprise felt that young
girls go astray, even from the homes of the
well-to-do classes. They escape from the
vile discipline of the scourge like maddened
creatures, without a vestige of self-respect
or honour. We did not expect to find the
ancient fallacy of Virtue taught by Violence
displaying its cloven feet in so many households.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>A Rector</i> writes: &#8216;I am glad to see that
the subject of the punishment of children
is again alluded to in your columns. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
it was dropped too soon. Surely it is as
important and interesting a subject to Englishwomen
as tight-lacing which has occupied
more time and space than this thoroughly
practical and domestic question.</p>

<p>Although I am only in early middle life,
I am old-fashioned enough to regret the disuse
of corporal punishment both at home
and at school; and, with many others, I
believe that the loss of parental authority
and the precious independence and lawlessness
of young persons, are due in no small
degree to this fact. No longer ago than my
own childhood it was otherwise. I and my
brothers were whipped, and I believe we are
all the better for it. At any rate, we never
doubted then or since that our good mother
was right; I have never loved or respected
her the less for our well-deserved punishment.
Nor was the use of the rod confined
to boys. I remember we used to look with
a sort of awe upon a lady who lived near
us and attended the same church with a
family of girls, because it was the current
report that she was a very strict disciplinarian
and used the birch unsparingly. Nor
could I ever understand why girls should
not be whipped just as much as boys, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
deserved it. If the good old custom had
not been allowed to go out, there would not
have been so many girls of the period at the
present day. A dignitary of the Church
whom I know was so convinced of this, that
when he lost his wife he still occasionally
used the rod himself while his daughters
were still children. In former times both
home governesses and schoolmistresses used
the rod, both with boys and girls, as a matter
of course. I could quote instances in
abundance in proof of this; but things are
changed now, and for the worse. The birch
is happily still used in all the older grammar
schools for boys, but I fear that in
girls&#8217; schools it is seldom heard of&#8212;at least,
I should be very glad to hear it if your correspondents
can report otherwise.</p>

<p>I remember, some fifteen years ago, a boy
told it me as a rather wonderful thing that
at the school where his sister was, they
birched the girls just like boys. Whether
they do so still I do not know. I shall be
glad to say a few words more on this topic
on a future occasion.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Tiny</i> agrees with the remarks made by
<i>An English Lady</i> on the birchrod question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
There is something in it perfectly revolting
to any refined female mind. If children
are properly brought up, with a clear knowledge
of right and wrong, their education
being based upon sound religious teaching,
depend upon it at fifteen years of age they
will not require such a degrading punishment.
<i>Tiny</i> is a mother, and she would
never punish her child in such a way, and
were she positively compelled to do so the
pain and grief to herself would be far greater
than any the child would feel; and most
certainly <i>Tiny</i> would never boast of the
punishment as <i>A Mother</i> does.</p>

<p>Children are gifted with reasoning powers,
and should be taught that their first
duty is strict obedience&#8212;the unquestioning
obedience which is cheerfully given because
they know no-one can have their welfare so
much at heart as their parents. And mothers
should so act as to win the respect of
their children. How can an intelligent girl
of fifteen respect the mother who chastises
her as she would an unruly spaniel? Where
such correction is needed, depend upon it
the bringing up of the child is at fault.
Teach a child that her mother is her best
friend, enter into all her childish pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and sorrows, and at fifteen she will be a
companion, not a plague.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>A Scotch Mother</i> says: It appears from
the letters in your magazine that some correspondent
wishes further information on
the subject of whipping children. Now, before
the subject closes, I would be much
obliged to any of your lady correspondents
who would give me information through
your columns on the following points:&#8212;Whether
a whipping has more good effect
on boys than girls&#8212;that is to say, which
requires the rod to be used most seldom;
and also at what age can boys be whipped
by ladies, my opinion being that except at
a very early age few ladies can inflict a
chastisement on boys sufficiently severe to
be remembered.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb">In regard to the proper chastisement of
the young, <i>Agnes</i> writes: &#8216;While you have
so many opinions expressed both for and
against corporal punishment for girls, perhaps
the opinion of one who has herself suffered
during her youth may be acceptable.</p>

<p>Up to the age of sixteen I was educated
at home, and I believe to a certain extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
spoiled. On arriving at that age I was
placed at a finishing school near Bath, in
the charge of a lady who was dearly loved
by all her pupils, but at the same time did
not fail to punish them severely for their
faults. At the same time I had a very bad
habit of boastful fibbing&#8212;a habit which she
reprimanded very sternly soon after I was
placed there; this not having the desired
effect, she one morning sent for me to her
sitting-room, and there told me of her intention
of endeavouring to effect a cure of
this habit by inflicting a whipping. I was
then sent to my bedroom in charge of a governess,
to remove my underclothing, and on
my return to the sitting-room, was obliged
to lie across an ottoman, while the punishment
was inflicted with a birchrod. I was
somewhat resentful at the time, but have
since had much cause to be grateful, for two
or three similar applications completely
cured me.</p>

<p>This is now eight years ago, and should I
ever have any daughters, I should not hesitate
to treat them in a like manner.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>The Husband of a Schoolmistress</i> writes:
&#8216;My wife keeps a boarding-school for little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
girls. The youngest is just turned six; the
eldest about twelve. One of the pupils,
just turned nine, was detected in a moral
offence. My wife took her into a private
room alone and chastised her with a rod.
The mother called the following day, was
indignant, and removed the child. I claimed
a quarter&#8217;s payment, in lieu of notice.
This was peremptorily refused. It was
agreed that the question should be referred
to a neighbouring magistrate, a retired barrister
with a family of daughters. He heard
the child&#8217;s statement and that of the mother
as to the marks on the child&#8217;s person.
When they had finished he asked my wife
whether she had been in the habit of so
punishing her scholars; to which she answered
in the affirmative. He then said he
did not wish to hear anything more from
her, that his own children were so corrected,
and that the quarter&#8217;s payment in lieu
of notice must be paid.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>A Rector</i> writes: &#8216;It would be a difficult
task to enumerate the numberless authorities
in favour of corporal punishment for
children from Solomon to our own day.
Some of the greatest names would be con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>tained
in the list. Thus Dr. Arnold always
defended and advocated this form of discipline,
and practised it himself. The head
of another large public school, in his evidence
before the Royal Commission, not
only declared it was the wisest and most
efficacious form of punishment, but said it
had a good effect upon the mind and body
of children&#8212;it quickens the circulation of
the blood, and is therefore specially beneficial
to children of sluggish temperament
and dull understanding. I believe he quoted
the opinion of medical men in support
of this.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It has a good effect also as
teaching that sin brings pain. It is nonsense
to talk of reasoning with children.
Authority is what they require. Reason
will come in due time, but the first duty of
the parent is to secure obedience. Many
parents are evidently most unfit for their
responsible position and have no right to
be parents. They will only bring up undisciplined
children who will cause misery
to themselves and others. Many of your
correspondents are evidently of this class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>of ignorant and silly parents. If children
are properly brought up, the use of the rod
will become less frequent as they grow older,
till it will be altogether laid aside, and a
word, a look, or a remonstrance will be
enough. Many children nothing but pain
will subdue; passionate children, sulky and
obstinate children, and those addicted to
falsehood and idleness, are such. A prompt
and severe whipping will do what hours of
reasoning or pleading will not effect, and
this is better for the child and the parent
too. There is no punishment that girls and
boys dread so much as a whipping. It is a
real punishment and a personal one, while
many of the substitutes for it are unequal,
unfair, injurious, and ineffective.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>A Schoolmistress</i> writes: &#8216;I am rejoiced
to see that the subject of the personal chastisement
of children is again being brought
forward. Now no one has tested the exceeding
efficacy of the systematic use of the
rod more than I have done, so I gladly give
my experience&#8212;extending now over thirty-five
years. Up to twelve years of age I was
brought up by my aunt, who kept up my
father&#8217;s house (my mother died when I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
very young). During this time no attempt
was made to correct by physical pain (except
of the mildest description) my many
evil propensities and bad habits; but after
I was twelve, my father married again, and
I was sent to a boarding-school in Norwich
where, when I had been about three weeks,
I had my first whipping. I had been guilty
of gross misconduct, and told a lie to screen
myself. The punishment inflicted on me
was the beginning of my entire reformation.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that first whipping,
how I was told after prayers to go to Mrs.
S.&#8217;s private room; how, after a most loving
reprimand, I was told that as reproof had
failed to do me good, I must prepare to be
whipped. Mrs. S. then rang the bell, and
giving to the maid who answered it a long
woollen dress which she took from a hanging
closet, bade her see that I put that on
and came back to her. The maid, an old
confidential servant, took me into Mrs. S.&#8217;s
bedroom, made me undress and don the
long woollen garment, which fastened round
the waist with a band and was open down
each side from the waist to the feet. I then
was bidden to put my feet in a pair of list
slippers. This being done, the maid, car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>rying
off all my clothes to my own bedroom,
requested me to go back to the room where
I had left Mrs. S., and give four knocks at
the door. Instead of doing this, I lingered
in the passage, where the maid found me a
few minutes afterwards. She told me to
follow her. I did so, and she remained till
I had knocked four times at the door. On
being told to enter, I found Mrs. S. sitting
at a table reading, but on the table lay a
long lithe rod; pushing the table on one
side, she took up the rod, pointed to a long
narrow stool, which I afterwards knew as
the Horse, and told me to lie across it. The
previous preparation and Mrs. S.&#8217;s manner
so awed me that I submitted. I then found
myself buckled across by a strap across the
horse. I heard Mrs. S. fasten the door and
draw a heavy curtain across it. She then
very quickly folded the back part of the
woollen dress&#8212;which was open on each side
from the waist to the feet&#8212;above the waist;
then very briefly speaking of my faults, she
grasped the rod and gave me very deliberately
a most severe birching. Of course I
screamed, and shrieked, and implored, but
the rod pursued its destined course and did
its destined work. The stinging pain, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
after-feeling and marks, the present shame,
the necessary submission, the ceremony
observed&#8212;all did their work; and as I took
my course to bed, I felt the first overthrow
of the old rebellious nature. From that
time till I was sixteen I had to pay seven
similar visits, and go through even more
severe whippings. But behold the fruit!
At nineteen I became a teacher in the same
school; I remained for ten years Mrs. S.&#8217;s
most trusted assistant. I have now for
many years had a school of my own, and I
myself administer corporal punishment
in precisely the same way as I have described,
and we have never known it to fail.
Dozens of pupils, in their happy after-lives,
have gratefully thanked me for my discipline.
I am most anxious that this should
be made public, and will gladly furnish
many special cases and give all information.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>A Rejoicer in the Restoration of the Rod</i>
says: &#8216;I call myself by this title because I
do most firmly believe that a great many of
the acknowledged evils of the present age&#8212;undutiful
children, and reckless, heedless
young men and women&#8212;arise from so many
parents and teachers having of late years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
neglected a most essential duty in not using
sufficient and proper corporal punishment.
But from all I hear a great reaction is taking
place in this respect. And though there
may be many loving mothers, like <i>Tiny</i>,
who shrink from it, yet I rejoice that true
love is being more shown in duty triumphing
over sentiment, and that the birchrod
is regaining its old place both among boys
and girls; so much so that I believe it is a
very rare thing to find a preparatory school
for boys&#8212;especially those conducted by
ladies&#8212;where the rod is not more or less
used. I know one most excellent school of
this kind in Kentish Town, where there are
boys from six to fourteen, and where the
very kind and good ladies who manage it,
and who always have more applications for
admission than they can receive, administer
the rod in a way which, if <i>A Scotch Mother</i>
could witness, would effectively negative
her idea of ladies not being able to birch a
boy worth mentioning after he ceased to be
a little boy.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Florence</i> thus narrates her experience:
&#8216;Both my brother and myself were spoiled
in the fullest sense of the word. My father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
spoiled me, and my mother spoiled my
brother. However, when I was fourteen
years of age my parents were compelled to
go abroad for mamma&#8217;s health, and I was
left under the guardianship of a maiden
aunt, who quickly decided that a strict
school was the best place for me.</p>

<p>To a school in Hertfordshire I was accordingly
sent, the mistress having been previously
informed that I was a child of wayward
disposition. I had not been there a
week before the spirit of opposition which
pervaded me, as my aunt used to term it,
got me into hot water, and I was ordered
to bed. I had not been undressed many
minutes when Miss Margaret, one of the
principals, came into the bedroom and, after
lecturing me on my conduct, told me she
intended to whip me. She then rang the
bell, and one of the maids brought a birch,
and I was told to prepare, which I flatly
refused to do. As I was rebellious, the
maid tied my hands together with a towel,
the ends of which were fastened to a peg
high up on the wall, so that I could only
just reach the floor with the tips of my toes.
Miss Margaret then gave me a severe flogging.
Finding I was obstinate, after a min<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>ute
or two she desisted and left the room,
leaving me with the maid. I tried hard to
get off the peg, but could not. When Miss
Margaret returned she asked me whether I
was sorry. &#8220;No&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;Then I
must whip you again,&#8221; she said, suiting the
action to the word. This second whipping
was too much for my spirit, and I begged
for forgiveness. The rest of the day I did
not cease crying, not so much from the pain
as from mortification that I had met my
match and been conquered. Strange as it
may seem, from that day to the present I
have loved Miss Margaret, and felt her to
be a true friend.</p>

<p>As I believe great benefit has resulted
from corporal punishment, I think it right
to advocate it, for I know from observation
that if our faults are not corrected when we
are young, we generally suffer in a far harder
school when we grow up.&#8217;</p>

extremely disobedient and naughty. The
only punishment that I have inflicted on
them is a box on the ears, or sending them
to bed, neither of which I find does them
any good. Their father has given me full
control over them, and says if I find it well
to whip them to do so; but I would first
like to ask some elder sister who has had
the bringing up of some younger ones if it
is well for a sister to administer corporal
punishment? I see none of the letters in
your magazine are from sisters, or I would
not have troubled you with this. I see
most of your correspondents advocate a
bunch of twigs as the best instrument of
correction. I should like to ask if they
leave any marks for any length of time,
when applied without covering; because I
do not wish to be too severe, although I
should like the punishment to be effectual.</p>

<p>By inserting this as soon as possible, you
will greatly oblige.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb">A lady, signing <i>Experience</i>, writes: &#8216;As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
many of your readers seem anxious to know
how to punish girls of fifteen years old and
upwards, I take the liberty of informing
you that about three years ago my eldest
girl gave me a good deal of trouble by disregarding
my directions and orders. She
was then turned sixteen, was home from
school for her holidays, and evidently
thought that under those circumstances she
was entitled to do just what she pleased.</p>

<p>I spoke to her two or three times very
seriously, and at last threatened that if she
continued to disregard what I said to her I
should be compelled to enforce my orders
with the birch. When my children were
little I had been used, if they were naughty,
to lay them across my knee and whip them
with my slipper or a small birchrod, but
now this mode of procedure was not available,
as my daughter was too big for that
treatment, and would only laugh at the
slight pat she would receive. It being a
real struggle for the mastery, it was important
that my authority should be supported,
and if it were not for this I do not think
that I should have whipped her at all. What
I did was this: I bought a birch broom and
took from it twenty long, stiff, and bushy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
switches, tied them together with string,
the handle being about as thick as my wrist.</p>

<p>Shortly after it was made I had occasion
to use it. I first lectured the culprit, and
then pinioned her arms behind her back,
laid her across a sofa, and applied the birch
sharply. She promised amendment, and I
left off, telling her at the same time that I
would whip her again if she broke her word.
Before a week was over she had done so,
and I was afraid that what I had done was
useless, perhaps worse. However, I determined
to give it another trial. I did so,
this time making her first remove her drawers.
I gave her twenty strokes deliberately,
and with excellent effect, for since she
has conducted herself well, and I have not
had to repeat the experiment. My advice
to mothers is this: Do not use the rod unless
you are absolutely obliged, but if you
do use it make it smartly felt. It is no disgrace
to a girl to be whipped by her mother&#8212;the
disgrace is in deserving it. Boys
of the very highest birth are constantly
flogged by their fathers and masters, and
why should not a girl be whipped by her
mother or governess.&#8217;</p>

<p><i>Alice de V.</i> writes: &#8216;Surely if the letters
upon chastising children are real, they cannot
be written by <i>ladies</i>, but must come
from those who are &#8220;born in the garret&#8212;in
the kitchen bred,&#8221; &#8220;whose &#8216;usbands
keep &#8216;orses, and &#8216;unt the &#8216;ounds three times
hevery week.&#8221; No wonder we hear such
things of the modern girl when there are
such mammas in the world! Why do they
not civilize themselves, correct their own
evil dispositions and set a good example to
their children, instead of chastising them
for being small editions of their coarse-minded
mammas? I am confident that whipping
girls degrades them and takes away
every feeling of self-respect and modesty. I
think the letter from <i>A Schoolmistress</i> conclusively
proves this.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>A Musicmaster</i> writes: &#8216;I have read the
correspondence relating to the personal
chastisement of young ladies in your pages
with great interest; and as your correspondent
who signs himself <i>Rector</i> seems to doubt
its application, I just write a few lines from
my own personal observation to convince
him to the contrary. I am a teacher of
music in five schools conducted by ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
and in two of these the most strict discipline
is kept up. When I am giving a music
lesson the lady principal remains in the
room, and the pupils keep coming one at a
time to have their ciphering and writing
books inspected; and if these are untidily
kept or the pupil has not been diligent, she
is ordered to hold out her hand, and receives
several smart slaps on the palm with
an instrument which I will proceed to describe.
It consists of a leathern strap, narrowed
at one end to fit the hand of the
mistress, and divided at the other end into
five tails. The consequence is that each
strip of leather inflicts a separate blow upon
the pupil&#8217;s hand; and the punishment, although
sufficiently severe, leaves no bruise
upon the hand, a great advantage over the
cane. With this strap there is no danger
of seriously damaging the hand, and the
pain, though severe, soon passes off; and
it has this advantage over the birch, that
there is no exposure, and the age of the pupil
is of no consequence. This, I think, is
of great importance, as my experience has
convinced me that it is not always the
youngest pupils in a school who require
correction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>I have frequently seen this punishment
applied to the hands of pupils of sixteen
years of age, and I am quite sure it is productive
of the most beneficial effects. I am
certain most of your readers will agree with
me that the use of the birch is quite out of
the question with young ladies of this age;
and the most convincing proof of the utility
of this kind of punishment lies in the fact
that in both of these schools where corporal
punishment is inflicted the lessons are invariably
gone through better than in any
of the other three where it is not used, and
the behaviour of the pupils is much more
ladylike. To my mind this mode of punishment
is by far the best, and it is easily
applied. The age of the pupil is not of
much importance, and the palm of a young
lady&#8217;s hand is sufficiently sensitive to allow
of a tolerably severe punishment being inflicted;
and my opinion is that punishment
should be seldom inflicted, but when it is
required it should be sharp and severe. It
is very seldom indeed that I am compelled
to report a pupil to the principal, but whenever
I am compelled to do so punishment is
promptly inflicted, and the girl is always
more attentive at the next lesson. In con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>clusion,
I must say that I cannot understand
why this kind of punishment on the
hand, to which boys are so freely subjected,
should be considered inapplicable to
young ladies.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Medical Student</i> writes: &#8216;With regard to
the whipping of girls, I think that as this
is the age of the ladies, there is no reason
why girls should not be whipped as well as
boys. But let me remind some of your
correspondents that the days when Milton
was whipped at Oxford are long gone by,
and if the girls require to be whipped at
sixteen they will require it all their lives. I
suppose that their husbands are the only
persons on whom the duty will devolve after
they have left the paternal mansion.
Now, as husbands are punished for thrashing
their wives, why should not schoolmistresses
be punished for doing the same by
young ladies of sixteen committed to their
care?&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Gratitude</i> writes: &#8216;I own, as you see, one
of the most honoured names in England,
and call myself <i>Gratitude</i> because I am anxious
to show my gratitude for the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
that I owe my present position as a useful
happy English lady to the firm discipline I
experienced at the very turning-point of my
life. I was brought up in a loving home
and had every possible advantage; but
amidst it all I became sullen, self-willed,
disobedient and idle. I was the grief of my
parents and a byword to my companions.</p>

<p>However, soon after I was fifteen I most
fortunately was sent to Mrs. &#8212;&#8217;s school for
young ladies, in Brighton, where I showed
the same evil disposition which I had evinced
elsewhere, but where, most fortunately
and happily for me, it was checked and
cured.</p>

<p>In school and out of it, during the first
month, Mrs. &#8212; and the other teachers reproved
me, set me tasks and kept me in.
But I only grew worse; and one night after
I had refused to do an imposition, Mrs. &#8212;
came and sat in my room after I was in bed
and talked to me most impressively. The
next day, however, the effect of what she
had said wore off, and I was as bad as ever.</p>

<p>But a change was at hand, for in the
evening, when we had just gone to our bedrooms,
Mrs. &#8212; again came to me, and said:
&#8216;Miss W., you will to-night occupy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
dressing-room adjoining my room. I will
show you the way.&#8221; I was half inclined to
disobey. However, I followed my governess
through her bedroom and across a small
sitting-room which opened out of it into a
room comfortably furnished, in which was
a small low bed, and telling me to undress
and go to bed, Mrs. &#8212; left me, locking the
door after her. I had been in bed about a
quarter of an hour when Mrs. &#8212; came to
me, holding in her hand a long birchrod.
Placing the rod and the candlestick on the
table, she told me that but one course was
now open to her after my behaviour, and
that she was going to flog me, and I was to
get up. But though the twigs of the birch
stood out in ominous shadow in front of the
candlestick, and while I noted the thin,
closely wrapped bundle of that rod and its
fanlike top, I never attempted to obey.
Three times she told me to get up, but I
stirred not. Mrs. &#8212; returned to her own
room, and came back with a small thin riding
whip, and said: &#8216;Must I use this?&#8221;
There was something about her which quite
awed me&#8212;it was more her manner than her
tall powerful figure&#8212;and as she swung that
whip about in her hand I at once stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
out of bed and stood before her. &#8220;Give
me your hands,&#8221; she said, but I put them
behind me, when slash across my shoulders
came six or seven smart strokes of her whip,
and screaming I put out my hands, which
she fastened together with a cord at the
wrists. Then making me lie down across
the foot of the bed face downwards, she
very quietly and deliberately, putting her
left hand round my waist, gave me a shower
of smart slaps with her open right hand&#8212;a
proceeding which so surprised and humiliated
my proud self that I could hardly
believe in my own identity, and as I screamed
and struggled, she merely said: &#8220;This
is for not doing <i>now</i> as I told you, and it
will not only punish you for <i>that</i>, but will
increase the pain of the birching I am now
going to give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. &#8212; then, as I lay, spoke to me for a
few minutes with great kindness and earnestness.
She then rose, took the birch in
her right hand, and stooping over me, pressed
her left hand tightly on my shoulder so
as to hold me as if I were in a vice; then
raising the birch, I could hear it whizz in
the air, and oh, how terrible it felt as it
came down, and as its repeated strokes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
came swish, swish, swish, on me! yet I felt,
spite of the terrible stinging pain, that I deserved
it all&#8212;and it <i>was</i> painful! I was a
stout fair girl, and very sensitive to pain.
I screamed, I protested, I implored, but it
was of no avail; Mrs. &#8212; heeded not my
cries, but held me down and birched on till
she had finished a whipping which seemed
to have lasted an age, but which quite
changed my character. At last it <i>was</i> over.
I was permitted to rise, my hands were unbound,
and, burning and smarting, I raised
my tear-stained face to my true friend&#8217;s, on
whose face no sign was visible of the slightest
anger or passion. Calm and serene, she
wished me good-night and left me conquered.
Henceforward I was a different girl;
and though a few weeks afterwards I relapsed,
yet another night spent in Mrs. &#8212;&#8217;s
dressing-room and another similar application
by her of that wonder-working birch&#8212;I
did exactly as she told me this time&#8212;sufficed
finally to cure me. I became cheerful,
obedient, unselfish. My parents and
friends the next holidays could hardly believe
that I was the same girl. I stayed
three years at Brighton, leaving when I was
nineteen with much regret. I am now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
twenty-four, and hope to be married at
Easter to <i>the best man in the world</i> who never
<i>could</i> have loved me had not sensible
wholesome discipline changed my evil nature,
as <i>the</i> means under God of doing so. I
am thankful to publish my experience, and
so to express not only my gratitude, but
confirm what others have so well said and
told on this subject.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Emma</i> writes: &#8216;A while ago I undertook
to bring up two nieces of the ages of twelve
and fourteen. I soon found them to be
most stubborn tempers and impudent.
Thus they have often caused me much
trouble and annoyance. Though not an
advocate of corporal punishment, I was
much struck with the description by <i>A
Schoolmistress</i> of a most ceremonious method
of inflicting punishment that I determined
to follow exactly the same method and
try it the same morning.</p>

<p>I prepared a woollen dress; not being
able to procure a birch, I sent and had
made a pair of very pliant leather taws. In
the afternoon I found the eldest of my
nieces in a gross fault, and on being found
fault with she was very pert. I therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
took her to my bedroom and made her don
the garment and follow me to the drawing-room,
she never thinking for a moment of
what was to follow. I then quietly told
her of her bad conduct for some time past,
and that I was determined to try what a
whipping would do. On ordering her to lie
across an ottoman, she distinctly refused. I
told her if she did not at once comply I
would ring for a servant to compel her.
Still refusing, I rang for assistance. Hearing
the servant coming upstairs, and seeing
me determined, she lay down rather than
be seen by the servant in this predicament,
wherefore I went to the door and sent the
servant back. I then fastened her across
the ottoman and proceeded to administer a
few strokes of the taws, which soon elicited
cries for forgiveness and promises for future
good conduct, but being determined to try
the efficacy of this method, I continued until
I had given her a severe flogging. I then
allowed her to rise, and on her knees to
thank me for the correction, then sent her
off to bed for the day. Up to this time the
perfect subjection and submission of this
girl is such that I most heartily recommend
all parents and guardians to try the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
method in all cases of disobedience. I think
that in all whippings of grown children a
large amount of cool ceremony is most effectual.&#8217;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>An Old Boy</i> writes: &#8216;Since the question
of the efficacy of corporal punishment seems
to give rise to a great variety of opinions, I
venture to give mine.</p>

<p>When a boy I was educated at Christ&#8217;s
Hospital, and I assure you the birch was
not neglected there. Punishment was sometimes
inflicted privately, but when the offence
was serious due publicity was given
it. The offender after supper was made to
stand opposite the warden&#8217;s desk and hold
the instrument of torture in his hand (it being
customary for punishments to be doled
out after that meal). When the boys had
retired (with the exception of the ward to
which the delinquent belonged, who were
ordered to remain in their seats), two of the
school porters were summoned, and the offender
was told to prepare himself. He was
then hoisted on the back of one of the porters,
when the other with great deliberation
proceeded to remove all unnecessary clothing
by tucking the inner garment beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the back of his coat, and after having measured
his distance, commenced the punishment,
always allowing a little time between
each stroke so as to give them due effect.
The offender, having received the allotted
number, was let down, and after finishing
his toilet was allowed to retire with his fellows,
who generally condoled with him if he
bore it well.</p>

<p>After once receiving a punishment of this
kind it seldom required to be repeated. But
it would be a good thing if schoolmasters,
guardians and parents would study the
characters of the children committed to
their charge, as they would soon ascertain
what punishment would be most effectual.</p>

<p>I am convinced that flogging does not
suit every case, though it might be effectual
in extreme ones; but I think it is a great
mistake to suppose that that is the only
punishment that ought to be inflicted, as in
some cases a word is more effectual, especially
with sensitive children. I am surprised
that girls should require such correction,
but I am acquainted with one or two to
whom a good wholesome flogging would indeed
be a great boon to themselves and
their parents.&#8217;</p>

being the third time the girl had been detected,
she determined to give her a good
whipping and, having bought a rod for the
purpose, told the culprit to go to her bedroom

In a few minutes she went upstairs and,
having fastened the girl across the bed,
birched her severely. The fruit of the punishment
was, that from that time the girl
improved, and is now finally cured.&#8217;</p>

<h3><i>The True Story of Father Girard and
Miss Cadière.</i></h3>

<p>One day Girard informed his penitent
that she was to be favoured by a remarkable
vision, during which she would (by
spiritual agency) be drawn up into the air,
he alone, as her spiritual Father would be
permitted to witness this manifestation;
but Miss Cadière, at the appointed time,
was not in a willing mood, in spite of the
Holy man&#8217;s threats and entreaties. She
resisted the spiritual influence, held fast to
her chair, and would not permit herself to
be drawn up. Finding his expostulations
useless, the Father quitted the room in a
rage, and sent Guiol to rebuke his pupil.
Although Miss Cadière, when in a calmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
mood the same evening, asked pardon and
promised future obedience, Girard determined
that her crime should be expiated
by a heavy penance.</p>

<p>The next morning, accordingly, he visited
her and, flourishing a discipline, said:
&#8216;God demands in his justice that you, having
refused to allow yourself to be invested
with His gifts, should now, in punishment
for your sins, undress yourself and be chastised.
Truly have you deserved that the
whole Earth should witness this infliction
on you; but God has graciously permitted
that only I and this wall (which cannot
speak) should be witnesses of your shame.
But beforehand, swear to me an oath of fidelity,
for both you and I would be plunged
into ruin if the secret was discovered.&#8217;</p>

<p>Girard had his desire, Miss Cadière humbly
submitted to discipline, and the scene
which followed we must leave the reader to
imagine.</p>

<h3><i>The King of Fiji and his Wives.</i></h3>

<p>In a recent work on Fiji and the Fijians
there is a graphic account of the marriage
ceremony or contract as observed in this
savage region. The misery of the woman
begins directly after the ceremony. If she
be young and pretty the old big-fisted wives
turn their venom against her and do all
they can, by mauling and ill-treatment, to
render her as unsightly as themselves. If
she be of the brawny sort, as well able to
give as to take a thrashing, then she is hated,
and all sorts of secret means are used
to work her ruin. As may be easily imagined,
these domestic brawls occasionally in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>terfere
with the peace of the lord of the establishment.
What does the despotic husband
do in such a case? Does he go out
and reason with the rowdies? Does he use
gentle persuasion? Does he! He has by
him a stout stick kept for the purpose, and
he lays about him till order is restored.</p>

the waist, tied their feet and took one at a
time on his back. The executioner stood
at three paces distance with a large pizzle,
to the end of which were fastened three
raw-hide thongs. Blood flowed at every
blow.</p>

<h3><i>The Flagellating Monks and the Bear.</i></h3>

<p>At Lent time, when religious fraternities
are accustomed to inflict on themselves certain
discipline, there was in a certain Italian
city a confraternity of Penitents. A pastry-cook
in the same city had a tame bear which
ran about the streets, doing no harm to
anyone. Wandering about one evening, it
found its way into the chapel (the door of
which was open), coiled itself up in a corner
and went to sleep. When the penitents
were all assembled, the door was locked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
and after a short exhortation from the altar,
they spread themselves about the chapel.
The light was hidden behind a pillar;
the most zealous commenced by inflicting
punishment on themselves, an example that
was soon followed. The noise woke up the
bear who, in trying to make his way out,
stumbled against the penitents who, with
their breeches down, were inflicting castigations.</p>

<p>The bear felt with his paw to find what
it was; from one behind he passed on quietly
to another; and the penitents in their
fear began to think it was the devil who
had come there to disturb them in their devotions.
Their suspicions became a certainty,
when the bear passing by the pillar
where the light was, they saw his shadow
on the wall. It was who could get to the
door first! And to this day nothing would
convince these worthy disciplinarians that
they had not received a visit from the arch
fiend in person.</p>

them come in and see how naughty children
are punished when they rebel against lawful
authority.&#8217;</p>

<p>So saying, he came tripping across the
room and flung the door open, admitting
into a somewhat odd scene. Fifine was tied
across a heavy chair in the middle of the
room, crying as if her heart would break,
her clothes turned up with the utmost precision,
while the ugliest old man I ever saw
was administering a whipping, which had
already been severe, judging from the state
of her hips and her tear-stained swollen face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pardon, ladies,&#8217; he said with an odious
leer. &#8216;Shall not a man do what he likes
with his own? This lady is my runaway
wife, my chattel, my goods: and who shall
forbid my chastising her when I find her?&#8217;</p>

<h3><i>Fanciful Flogging.</i></h3>

<p>She got hold of a book out of the library
about the feminine customs of Rome, and
she resolved to make me attend upon her
toilet as the slaves of Roman ladies did.
So she looked up a short tunic which was
among the fancy dresses, and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
morning she made me go and strip, and
come back to her with nothing on but this
garment, which was just like a sack, with
short sleeves only, of soft white merino
trimmed with red satin. It did not come
to my knees, and my legs and feet were
bare except for a pair of red sandals.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now take care what you are about, Perkins,&#8217;
she said. &#8216;I am going to deal with
you exactly as the ladies in Rome dealt
with their slaves.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I am not a slave, my lady,&#8217; I said,
pertinently enough, I dare say, for I felt
angry. &#8216;There are no slaves here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You are mine as long as you are in this
room,&#8217; she replied. &#8216;When my toilet is
sufficiently completed I shall punish you
for that speech.&#8217; She made me bathe her
and dress her hair, and then before she put
on her stays she said quite calmly: &#8216;Bring
the rod.&#8217; I brought it, and she made me
kiss her and beg her pardon for what I had
said; and then I knelt on the couch, and
she whipped me till she was tired&#8212;and I,
well, I did not get over it for a long time.</p>

<h3><i>Revelations of Boarding-School Practices.</i></h3>

<p>At the age of seventeen I was sent to a
boarding-school near Exeter. I was sent
there owing to the influence of my aunt,
who was always praising this establishment
up to mamma, and strongly recommending
it as a finishing academy for young ladies.
My aunt was a maiden lady of forty, a fine,
tall, buxom woman.</p>

<p>Neither myself nor my mamma ever
thought she was an advocate of the rod,
and liked administering, and seeing it administered.
It turned out afterwards, as
the narrative will show, that she was really
in league with the schoolmistress, and would
frequently call at the establishment and indulge
herself in her favourite pastime, for
which she no doubt paid large sums yearly,
being a strong and fervent advocate of corporal
chastisement, at times an unseen observer
and with some of the elder young
ladies being the operator. In all there were
twenty-four young ladies in this fashionable
establishment, their ages varying from
twelve to nineteen. I was as tall, finely-shaped,
and handsome as any young lady
in the school, and no doubt when mamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
gave her consent to my leaving home, my
aunt thought there was a great treat in
store for her.</p>

<p>A few days after arriving, I soon found
out what sort of lady principal I had to contend
with, and her assistants were not much
better. The first sample I saw her administer
to one of her pupils was after I had
been there four days. A young lady about
fifteen had committed some trifling error,
for which madam told her in plain terms
that she should give her a good whipping
when class was over, and this she did and
in front of the whole school. She was taken
by the arms and legs by two of the assistant
teachers, and thrown face downwards
over a desk sloping each way and firmly
held there. Madam then approached with
a flat piece of wood about an inch and a
half in thickness and shaped like a hair-brush,
but much bigger. After addressing
a few words of advice to us and admonishing
the culprit, she took hold of her garments
at the bottom, then without any further
to do she lifted the spanker, as this
piece of wood was called by my school fellows,
and inflicted a tremendous spank on
the girl. A loud yell followed, and a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
effort to free herself from the grasp of her
tormentors, but all of no avail, for they, no
doubt owing to their previous experience,
could hold a young lady in any position.
She received about a dozen stripes before
she was released.</p>

<p>We had a system of making so many
marks, and if any young lady had not made
so many by the end of the week she was
sure to receive a whipping. I have known
as many as seven young ladies whipped on
a Saturday. It was at these whippings that
my aunt and her friends were present as
unseen spectators, through the medium of
small glass panels let in the door of a nearby
closet.</p>

<p>During my two years at this establishment
I was whipped several times. I shall
never forget my last experience. I think
the lady principal had made up her mind
that I should be flogged on the Saturday,
for at the early part of the week, however
well I did my lessons, fault was found with
me, and I got careless towards the end. On
Saturday I found my name on the Black
List, as it was called. I was number three
on the list, my two schoolfellows, both girls
about fourteen, had gone in and received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
their portion and, as usual, had been dismissed
to bed. I was then ordered in. I
need not tell you that I entered the room
trembling from head to foot. Madam called
me by my Christian name, and informed
me she was very sorry to have to inflict
punishment on such a big girl, but the rules
of the school must be enforced, winding up
by ordering me to prepare for punishment.
I dropped on my knees and begged her to
take into consideration my age and size;
in fact I hardly remember what I did say.
She was inexorable and, with a smile on her
face, ordered me to obey, or she would have
to call assistance and my punishment would
be much more severe. I made some remark,
when she seized me by my beautiful
long hair and beat me about my ears, head,
cheeks and arms with the birch, until I was
compelled to give in and promise obedience
in future.</p>

<p>Soon after, I found means to send a letter
to my mamma, informing her of the circumstances
related above. She accordingly
took steps for my early removal, and I was
soon afterwards married, but my mamma
and aunt have never been friends or spoken
to each other since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Flogging at Sea.</i></h3>

<p>However the arbitrary disposition and
impetuous temper of Governor Wall may
have been attenuated by years and reflection,
the following anecdote, which the writer
had from an eye-witness, has served to
show that Wall, in the infancy of his appointment,
evinced a species of vigour competent
to defer mutiny, even in a part more
desperate than Goree. This garrison, so
desperate in name, was every way orderly,
and during the kind and humane command
of Capt. Lacy, flogging was abolished altogether
on the remonstrance of the surgeon.
Stopping their grog was found more than
sufficient to check all irregularities.</p>

<p>Amongst the recruits consigned to his
command on his passage outwards, was an
unfortunate man named Green, who formerly
kept a hatshop in London and who,
under a conviction for some crime, was sentenced
to fourteen years transportation.
His wife, an amiable but heartbroken woman,
was permitted to accompany him on
the voyage.</p>

<p>Shortly after the vessel had sailed from
the Downs, symptoms of mutiny were dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>covered
among the convicts. Several had
sawn off their irons, and Green was charged,
not with any act of mutiny, but with furnishing
the convicts with money to procure
the implements for taking off their irons.
The unfortunate man stated in his vindication
that he had only lent some of the men
a few shillings to take some sheets and other
necessaries out of pawn. But his defence
would not do. He was brought to the
gangway by order of the Governor, and
without any trial was flogged with a boatswain&#8217;s
cat until his bones were denuded of
flesh. But the unfortunate man never
uttered a groan. The Governor, who superintended
the punishment, swore he would
conquer the rascal&#8217;s stubbornness and make
him cry out, or whip his guts out. The surgeon
remonstrated on the danger of the
man&#8217;s death, but in vain. Ensign Wall,
the Governor&#8217;s brother, a humane young
man, begged on his knees that the flogging
should cease, but also in vain; and his importunity
only served to provoke a threat
of having him arrested. He then entreated
the unfortunate Green to cry out and save
himself. But the unhappy man said it was
now too late, as he felt himself dying and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
unable to cry out; that he had not avoided
it from stubbornness, but concealed his
pangs lest his wretched wife, who was down
below and knew nothing of his situation,
should hear his cries and die with anguish.
The flogging was continued until the convulsions
of his bowels appeared through his
lacerated loins, when he fainted away and
was consigned to the surgeon, who appeared
at the trial.</p>

<p>This event stamped a melancholy horror
on the mind of the Governor&#8217;s brother that
was not abated during the voyage. On his
arrival at Goree he was seized with a raging
fever, in which he died, expressing horror
and execration at the cruelty of his brother,
whom he would not permit to come within
his sight, and who was subsequently tried
and sentenced.</p>


<h3><i>The Whipping Widow.</i></h3>

<p>It is not so very long ago when there suddenly
appeared in society a rich, or apparently
rich, widow, Mrs. W.... She lived in
good style, kept her carriage, and had a fine
house and plenty of well-trained servants.
No one knew the source of her wealth, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
she rapidly became popular in the best society,
and by her dashing manner and splendid
appearance won for herself an eminent
position in the fashionable world.</p>

<p>Like many fine ladies she cherished a secret
passion for the rod, and odd stories began
to circulate through the medium of the
maids, of the way she used it on herself and
them, and report says she was accustomed
to use the rod upon her late husband very
freely. After his death, she became acquainted
with a young student who used to
visit her home on pretence of giving lessons,
but in reality it was to receive a good whipping
from her hands.</p>


<h3><i>Miraculous Cure by the Birch.</i></h3>

<p>Father Nicolo of Narni was a celebrated
preacher with a quick eye, when in the
pulpit, over the female part of his flock.</p>

<p>He was one day preaching at Catanea, in
Sicily, when amongst the rest of his auditory
he spied out a very agreeable young
woman named Agatha, wife of one Ruggieri,
a physician, and was immediately enamoured
with her beauty. The lady was
so devout as to have her eyes constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
fixed on the preacher, and could not help
perceiving that he was handsome, nor wishing
secretly that her husband were no less
agreeable. After sermon she addressed herself
for confession to Father Nicolo who was
overjoyed at this lucky opportunity of discovering
his passion. Agatha had soon
despatched the account of her own sins;
after which she very generously confessed
for her husband too, and asked the holy
man if he had no cure for an old man&#8217;s jealousy.
The Father replied that jealousy was
a passion to be avoided by the lucky person
who possessed so divine a creature. Agatha
smiled, and thinking it time to return to
some female friends who were waiting for
her, desired absolution. The priest sighed,
and said: &#8216;My fair daughter, who can free
another that is bound himself? I am chained
by the irresistible power of your beauty,
and without your assistance I can neither
absolve myself nor you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Agatha was young and inexperienced, yet
by the help of a good natural understanding
she was not at a loss to unravel his meaning.
She had besides, to quicken her wit,
been strictly guarded and ill-used by her
husband. She therefore soon let the Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
see that she understood him, and that she
was not displeased to find, notwithstanding
the sanctity of his character, that he was
flesh and blood. The business of absolution
was not forgotten: Father Nicolo urged his
passion and, at his earnest request, the lady
undertook to find means for him to pay her
a visit. After a short time she acquainted
him, to this end, that she was troubled with
fits, and that all the medicines her husband
could administer procured her no ease;
therefore, said she, the next time he is sent
for into the country, I will feign myself
seized with my usual distemper, and send
to you to bring some relic of St. Griffon for
my relief. You will, I suppose, comply
with the summons, and one of my faithful
maids shall be ready to conduct you to my
chamber. The Father applauded her wit,
pronounced a thousand blessings on her for
this happy invention, and thus they parted.</p>

<p>Honest Ruggieri, who dreamt nothing of
what had passed, went very opportunely
out of town the next morning. The lady
was immediately seized with a terrible fit,
and in the midst of her attendants, who
were officious in helping her, frequently
called on the name of St. Griffon for assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>ance.
The crafty confidant that stood by,
and who was instructed with the secret, took
the hint and pressed her to send for the relics
of that saint which, she said, were famous
for their miraculous virtue and wonderful
cures. The mistress, who seemed scarce
able to speak, bid her do as she thought
fit. Father Nicolo presently had notice,
and obeyed the summons with the utmost
expedition.</p>

<p>The priest arrived and followed his guide,
entering the room where the afflicted lady
lay, and drawing near to the bed with a becoming
gravity. Agatha received him with
profound reverence and begged the charity
of his prayers. He exhorted her to prepare
herself that she might be qualified to receive
the benefit of the sacred relics and
birch he had brought; in order to which,
said he, it is first necessary that with a contrite
heart you confess, that your soul being
healed, your body may be more easily cured.
The lady said she desired nothing more, and
this was a signal to the others in the room
to depart, which they did, leaving the lovers
to their private devotions.</p>

<p>The good Father had not long applied
the birch and other relics of St. Griffon for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the recovery of the devout Agatha, when
Ruggieri was discovered at the entrance of
the street, back sooner than he was desired
or expected. The lovers were immediately
alarmed, and the holy friar leaped upon the
floor in such a funk that he forgot to take
his breeches, which he had thrown at the
bed&#8217;s head, as being unnecessary on that
solemn occasion.</p>

<p>The wench who was in the secret opened
the door and cried out that by the favour
of Heaven and St. Griffon her lady was almost
recovered, and called in the rest of the
attendants. Ruggieri arrived at the same
instant, but was not well pleased to observe
that a friar had found the way to his house;
nor was he less disturbed at this new illness
of his wife. Agatha perceived his disorder
by the change of his countenance, and immediately
told him that she had been infinitely
obliged to that holy Father, by
whose prayers, together with the application
of the Saint&#8217;s rod, she had been snatched
from the grave. The good man was
delighted to hear it was no worse and, correcting
himself in his own thoughts for his
former suspicions, very heartily thanked
the friar who, after some pious discourse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
was glad to withdraw.</p>

<p>Father Nicolo was not gone far before he
was recovered out of his fright, and at the
same time perceived he had left his breeches
behind him. This put him into a new concern;
he dared not go back, but comforted
himself as well as he could in the hope that
Agatha or her maid would find them first
and take care to prevent further mischief.
Ruggieri was now sitting on the bedside by
his wife and saying a thousand kind things
to her when, unluckily putting his hand to
adjust the pillow under her head, he had
hold on one of the strings and drew out the
breeches. This threw him into a worse fit
than any his wife had had; he stormed like
a madman, and asked how this appurtenance
of the friar came there. Agatha, who
had all her wits awakened by her new amour,
replied without the least hesitation
that it was what she had told him of. It is
to this, said she, I owe my cure. This is
the miraculous garment of St. Griffon which
the Holy Father brought, and he has left it
here for my greater security till the evening,
at which time he will send for it, or
fetch it himself.</p>

<p>Poor Ruggieri, hearing so ready and un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>expected
an answer, believed, or pretended
to believe her, and retired. The trusty
wench was now despatched on a new errand,
to desire the Father to send for his relics.
She understood her business, and acquainted
Nicolo with all that had passed. The
friar, pressed by the necessity of the case,
went to the warden of the house and, confessing
the whole intrigue, begged him to
help him. The warden sharply reproved
him for his negligence and said there was
no time to be lost, and something must be
thought of to save the reputation of the
Order. He therefore caused the chapter
bell to be rung and, the friars being all assembled,
he informed them that heaven had
that day wrought a most remarkable miracle
by virtue of St. Griffon&#8217;s birch and
breeches, in the house of Ruggieri the physician.
In short, he related to them the particulars
and persuaded them to go and fetch
back the holy garments, in solemn procession.</p>

<p>The friars were now drawn up in order,
and, with a cross carried before them and
the warden at their head holding the tabernacle
of the altar in his hand, marched
two and two in profound silence to Ruggi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>eri&#8217;s
house. The doctor met them at the
door and asked the reason of their solemn
visit. The warden told him they were obliged
by the rules of their order to send
their relics privately to such distressed persons
as desired the use of them; that if
through the sins of the patient the relics
had no effect, they were to fetch them as
privately back; but when a manifest miracle
is wrought, they were to bring them
home with decent ceremony, to publish the
miracle, and finally to record it in their register.
Ruggieri now understood their business
and expressed himself overjoyed at the
honour which was done him. He told the
Fathers they were all welcome and, desiring
the warden and Nicolo to follow him, he
led them to his wife&#8217;s chamber.</p>

<p>The good lady, who, it may be supposed,
was not asleep at this juncture, held the
breeches in her hand, bound decently up in
a perfumed napkin, which the warden having
opened, kissed them with profound reverence;
and having caused them to be
kissed in like manner by all who were in
the room, he put them in the tabernacle he
had brought for that purpose, and gave the
signal to his fraternity to return in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
same order.</p>

<p>The Fathers set forth in greater solemnity
than before and, singing an anthem,
marched round the city accompanied by a
great crowd, and then placing the relic on
the altar of their chapel, left it there as an
object of devotion. Ruggieri was zealous in
promoting reverence for the Order, and
wherever he went he told of the miracle of
the birch and breeches of St. Griffon.</p>


<h3><i>A Boy Whipped for Destroying Women&#8217;s
Apparel with Aquafortis.</i></h3>

<p>Until severe examples were made of the
actors in this kind of frolic and fun, females
often found their clothes drop to tatters,
and such as restricted themselves to mere
muslin and chemise were frequently dreadfully
burnt in a way invisible and almost
unaccountable. A set of urchins, neither
men nor boys, by way of a high game, procured
aquafortis, vitriol, and other corrosive
fluids, and filling therewith a syringe or
bottle, would sally forth to give the girls a
squirt. Of this mischievous description we
find Edward Beazley, who was convicted
of this unpardonable offence at the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Bailey, the 11th of March, 1811. He was
indicted for wilfully and maliciously injuring
and destroying the apparel of Anne
Parker, by feloniously throwing upon the
same a certain poisonous substance called
aquafortis, whereby the same was so injured
as to be rendered useless. He was also
charged on two other indictments for the
like offence, on two other women.</p>

<p>It appears that the prisoner, a boy of
thirteen, took it into his head to sally into
Fleet St. on the night of Sat. Feb. 16, and
there threw the same upon the clothes of
several of the Cyprians who parade up and
down there. He was caught, carried before
the magistrate at the Guildhall, and fully
committed on three charges.</p>

<p>Three ladies appeared and proved the
facts, and the boy was found guilty.</p>

<p>His master, Mr. Blades of Ludgate Hill,
gave him a good character; he never knew
anything wrong of him before, but admitted
he had access to the chemicals. The court
having a discretionary power, instead of
transporting him for seven years, only
ordered him to be well whipped in the jail
and returned to his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Ill-Treatment of Female Pupils.</i></h3>

<p>We frequently hear of the low-bred and
licentious of our sex ill-treating young helpless
females; but to find a minister of the
gospel convicted of so base and unmanly an
assault is a scandal to his office, and an aggravated
disgrace to human nature.</p>

<p>This abhorred man, a clergyman and
schoolmaster at Newton near Manchester,
was brought up to receive the judgment of
the King&#8217;s Bench at Westminster, in consequence
of having been convicted at the
last Lancashire Assizes on two indictments
for assaulting and whipping Mary Ann Gillicrand
and Mary Barlow, his scholars.</p>

<p>The defendant delivered in the affidavits
of several females who had been his scholars
in their youth, declaring upon oath that
they never saw him take the slightest liberty
with his pupils in an improper way, or
whip them severely, and that they thought
him a fit person to be intrusted with the
instruction of youth.</p>

<p>Mr. Scarlett addressed the court in mitigation.
The punishment, he said, that the
court would feel it due to justice to inflict
would be of little additional consequence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the defendant as his ruin was already consummated;
but he had a wife and six
children who had been virtuously bred and
educated, and it was on their account he
implored the court not to inflict a punishment
on the defendant which would render
him infamous.</p>

<p>Serjeant Cockell said it was not his wish
to bruise the bended reed, yet it was necessary
that an example should be made of
the defendant. He was a clergyman and a
teacher of youth; and the prosecutors, who
had acted from the most laudable motives,
had abundant reasons for what they had
done. They felt themselves irresistibly called
upon to check the practices imputed to
the defendant, and which there was too
much reason for believing he had indulged
in for a considerable time past.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Grose, in passing sentence,
addressed the defendant to the following
effect: &#8216;You have been convicted of an assault
on a child of very tender years; the
narrative of your conduct is horrible to
hear, and horrible to reflect upon&#8212;the aggravations
of your offence, I am sorry to
say, are multifarious&#8212;the object of your
brutality was a child committed to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
care, and you are a teacher, a man grey in
years and possessing a large family. In
looking to the class of misdemeanours, I
know of none so horrible as the one of which
you have been convicted. Of your guilt it
is impossible to doubt, and I am shocked
to see a clergyman standing to receive sentence
for such an offence.&#8217; The accused
was sentenced to three years imprisonment.</p>


<h3><i>Flogging with a Frying-pan.</i></h3>

<p>At the Woolwich Police court, Dec. 29th
1882, an elderly man named James Bone
was charged on a summons before Mr. Mersham
with assaulting Margaret Chapman.</p>

<p>The complainant, a widow, said that the
defendant engaged her to go to his house in
Nun St., Woolwich, and do a day&#8217;s washing.
There was no other person in the house, and
the defendant told her he had turned his
wife out of doors. About midday he gave
her a glass of spirits which took such effect
that she did not remember whether she had
any more or not. She remembered no more
until the evening, when she found herself
lying undressed upon the floor, and the defendant
pouring water over her from a pail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
He had stripped her of everything and beaten
her with some weapon about the body
until she was covered with bruises from
head to foot. As soon as she recovered
sufficiently she ran out of the house to escape
from his violence, and some women
got clothing for her.</p>

<p>Defendant said he gave the woman a
glass of stout with her lunch, and afterwards
a glass of brandy. He went out in
the afternoon, and when he returned, he
found that she had drunk a pint of rum and
was in a shocking state of intoxication.
She stripped herself and tried to go to bed,
but fell helpless on the floor, and he then
bathed her with cold water, spoiling his
new carpet, and also tried to bring her to
her senses by flogging her with the hot frying-pan.
He did not deny causing her
bruises, for he hit her perhaps a hundred
times, and if she had not been so heavy he
would have thrown her out of the window.
He tied a rope round her feet, but could
not drag her out of the room and, after giving
her some more water, she got up and
walked into the street just as she was. He
was so disgusted that if he could have got
a gun he would have shot her. All that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
could do was to send for a cab and get her
away.</p>

<p>Mrs. C. Limey said that she had occasion
to go to the house on business, and the defendant
showed her the complainant lying
stripped upon the carpet. She got up on
hearing a woman&#8217;s voice and ran into the
street. There were several weals upon her
body, and her clothes had evidently been
torn from her with violence.</p>

<p>The prisoner was remanded in custody
for a week.</p>


<h3><i>Extract from &#8216;The Revelations of Birchington
Grange.&#8217;</i></h3>

<p>Asking for a good birch rod, the Colonel
says he will show them the way a real expert
would use it, whisking the birch about
so that the trembling victim can hear it
hissing through the air.</p>

<p>The Colonel continues: &#8216;Now the real
art of birching consists, of course, in inflicting
the greatest amount of humiliation and
suffering, but without in reality doing serious
damage; we have to consider how so
to apply the rod as to effect some radical
moral good in the disposition and mind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the culprit; how to make them feel the
very dregs as it were of humiliation, degradation,
and every kind of mortification.
It is a curious fact that it sends the blood
of a sensitive modest girl in impulsive rushes
(especially to the face and neck) in the
form of scarlet blushes, which pass over
those parts in continuous waves, corresponding
to each stroke of the rod; this is
a curious psychological fact, which is puzzling
even to anatomists.&#8217;</p>


<h3><i>Letter from Mrs. Martinet on Slipper
Punishment.</i></h3>

<p>A slipper is a splendid thing to slap with,
as it has such a stinging effect without cutting
the skin, like a regular birchrod.</p>

<p>I should not write so fully as I do, but
knowing you to be an amateur, and consequently
interested in every incident of punishment,
it gives a kind of freedom to my
pen, as I know you can be depended on not
to abuse my confidence.</p>

<p>My special penchant used to be for a good
stinging bunch of real birch twigs, and I
still think that is far the best thing to use
for big girls over thirteen, but for little del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>icate
chits under that age, there is nothing
answers so well as a nice new slipper. A
proficient disciplinarian would first give the
delinquent a short lecture on the nature of
her offence, then firmly insist upon the culprit
herself fetching the instrument of punishment:
to my idea, there is more shame
and humiliation at having to bring the slipper
to be flogged, than fear of the smart,
which is always worse in imagination than
fact.</p>

<p>A skilful flagellatrix will always prolong
these sensations, as they effect as much good
as the application of the slipper.</p>


<h3><i>Flogging and Cruelty in a Glasgow
Industrial School.</i></h3>

<p>A case not unlike what has just been
brought to light in London is reported in
connection with the Glasgow Girls&#8217; Industrial
School. The charges against the matron
consist of acts of cruelty when administering
punishment to the girls. Here is
part of an account given in a Glasgow paper
of an interview with the matron regarding
her treatment of a girl who had absconded
from the institution. The girl was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
taken into the laundry with only her chemise
and a petticoat on, and held by two girls
while she flogged her with a taws. She
knows that the girl&#8217;s garments got twisted
in the struggle, but cannot remember whether
they all came off or not. She is sure the
girl did not receive more than twelve strokes,
very likely not so many. After flogging
the girl she went to her own room, she was
so excited, leaving instructions to have the
girl put under the spray-bath to cool her
down. After whipping the girls she gave
them the spray to revive them. Then a
mattress was taken into the surgery and
the girl was put in there. That very night
she visited her in the surgery, and told her
she had only punished her for her good.
She taught her a little prayer, and then she
prayed with her. The interview goes on to
say: &#8216;You did not enter the punishment
in the records?&#8217; &#8216;No, for the girl had never
been in the schoolroom, and the punishment
did not form part of the ordinary discipline
of the school.&#8217; &#8216;You consider that
the punishment requisite to break a girl in
should not be entered?&#8217; &#8216;Well, I go upon
precedent. I was assistant to the former
matron, and in a case where a girl was pun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>ished
under similar circumstances it was not
entered in the book.&#8217;</p>

<p>The matron mentioned above is also reported
by the same girl to have confessed
to stripping a girl naked before whipping
her. This lady who was assistant matron,
said she knew nothing about the rules. One
of the teachers who has since left the institution
said she did so out of disgust at the
way it was conducted, and the cruelty
practised in the punishment of the inmates.
The resignation of the matron was accepted
by the committee of management.</p>


<h3><i>The Convent School.</i></h3>

<p>The Superior, with whom Olive had been
a favourite, now vented her spite in every
direction amongst the young lady pupils of
the seminary, and I, for one, soon fell under
her displeasure and was ordered to be
tied to the whipping-post. It was only for
slightly oversleeping myself, and not dressing
quickly when the bell rang for us to get
up at 6 a.m. I was suspended by my wrist,
being tied high up on the post, as I stood
on a footstool, when it was suddenly kicked
away, the jerk of the sudden strain on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
wrists almost making the straps cut into the
flesh. My feet were dangling some inches
from the floor. &#8216;Oh! oh! ah-r-r-re!&#8217; I
screamed. &#8216;How cruel! Oh! papa! papa!
if you only knew how they treated us in
this awful place!&#8217;</p>

<p>The Lady Superior, who seemed delighted
at my pain, said: &#8216;Hold your foolish
tongue; wait till you have something to
scream about, girl.&#8217; Then old Serena who,
it seemed, was always in attendance at punishment
time, pinned up my skirts, and the
Superior went on: &#8216;This rod shall make all
the sluggards turn out quicker in the morning.
What do you mean, Miss, by making
us all wait prayers for ten minutes? Will
you wake up sharper in future?&#8217;</p>

<p>She then gave me several sharp cuts with
the rod. My screams were heartrending,
but they only seemed to enjoy it more and
more, and the Superior never ended her objurgations
till the rod was worn out.</p>


<h3><i>The Woman in White.</i></h3>

<p>Mme. Hauteville made a very pretty toilette
for the occasion&#8212;she was all in white:
in the costume of a novice when she takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the veil. The dress had been considerably
modified, as being too flowing for the occasion,
but it was all white silk and lace: and
a lovely little angel she looked when it was
complete. From head to foot she had nothing
on that was not pure white; white
satin shoes with diamonds sparkling on the
rosettes; white silk stockings, gartered above
her round knees with white velvet
garters; white petticoats&#8212;one of the finest
flannel&#8212;embroidered with lilies, and one of
soft lawn, with a lace flounce. Her robe
was silk&#8212;the soft noiseless sort that does
not rustle&#8212;richly trimmed with costly lace,
and over her head she had a square veil.
She had her maid in to assist at her toilette
and fasten her garters and shoes. Madame
submitted to be blindfolded with a very
good grace, though she tried hard to get us
to tell her what was going to be done; she
had such pretty coaxing ways that it was
hard to resist her; but we did, and she
went in quite unprepared.</p>

<p>We led her slowly up the room, and at
the first stroke of the rod nearest the door,
she winced but did not cry out; the next
blow she received was a stinging one from
a slipper my lady held in her hand (she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
knows how to strike with a shoe, I can tell
you), and she gave a little scream and a
jump. &#8216;Oh! what is it?&#8217; she asked between
her teeth; but the next stroke, a fair
open-handed slap from Mrs. D&#8212;&#8217;s fat hand
made her fairly shriek out and twist out of
her grasp on to the floor. It <i>was</i> a slap,
and rang out even above the laughter of
the ladies, leaving a broad red mark on the
white firm flesh of the little lady.</p>


<h3><i>Home Scenes.</i></h3>

<p>Mrs. Eden was brought up in a convent.
Her parents were Roman Catholics and,
having no daughter but her, they were desirous
of bestowing upon her every accomplishment,
and foolishly imagined a convent
education far superior to any this country
could boast of. There she lived till she was
twenty-five, when her father died, and she
found herself in possession of twenty-five
thousand pounds. At the importunities of
a fond mother, who went to see her every
year, she visited England and, being a girl
of good fortune, it is not to be wondered at
that she had a crowd of admirers. In her
visits she was very much taken with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
part of a widower&#8217;s family generally found
most disagreeable, at least to young ladies&#8212;I
mean his children. She observed they
were indulged by a weak father in everything,
and were consequently very disobedient
and unruly. Upon this gentleman,
though verging on forty, she fixed her affections,
and being a woman of ungovernable spirit,
she was happy to find him an
easy pusillanimous creature. The match
was scarcely mentioned when it was concluded,
and a few days after she found herself
at the head of his household. She had
six little subjects to govern, three of whom
were then at school, who were instantly ordered home,
as she said she would finish
their education, which indeed was in her
power, for she was a very sensible woman;
but that was not her intent altogether. It
was the boys that were ordered from school,
and right happy they were at leaving so
irksome a place; but they little knew their
stepmother. As soon as she was married
she discharged all her servants and hired a
set of her own choosing, and among the
rest she took care to engage a French maid
whose disposition she knew would just suit
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Eden was of the first order of beauty,
fine turned limbs, good skin, fine blue
eyes, and when not ruffled by passion was
certainly very captivating. If she stepped
across the room she displayed uncommon
dignity and elegance, and had all the chic
of a Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>Now although she had a passion for flogging,
yet she was never observed to take
the rod in hand without cause. She was
convinced where there were such a number
of children and they ungovernable, many
bickerings would arise which would give her
an opportunity to amuse herself with the
rod. The first to give her a chance was a
boy of seventeen who was so stupid at a lesson
she gave him that she resolved to try
the effects of birching. Her maid was ordered
to bring a rod, which was no sooner
done than she proceeded to use it; but she
found the boy too strong for her. The maid,
with the assistance of her mistress, tied his
hands behind him, and then they found him
manageable enough and, the woman holding
his legs, his stepmother whipped him
till the twigs flew about the room.</p>

<p>This was the first sample of her severity,
and it made such an impression on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
children that they trembled in her presence.
A few hours afterwards the boy was tearfully
complaining of her treatment to his
elder sister, who advised him to burn the
rod at the first opportunity. This was overheard
by the maid, who informed her lady
of the affair. The young lady was summoned
to the parlour, where she denied the
fact, was confronted by the maid, and well
whipped.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
